				<note resp="Philip Lampi">John Clary had been elected in the regular election to the House of Commons.  Accused of impregnating his step-daughter and with the Assembly threatening to "free itself from the contamination of grossly impure and unworthy characters," Clary resigned his seat and returned to Perquimans County to clear his name.  In this special election, he was again re-elected to the Assembly.  On December 20, the Assembly voted 68 to 28 to eject him for being "guilty of a crime so enormous it renders unfit that he should be permitted to continue as a member."</note>
