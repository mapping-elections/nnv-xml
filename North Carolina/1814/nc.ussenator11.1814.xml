                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"On Saturday last, after the various ineffectual ballotings which we have before stated, and some others, the name of James W. Clarke having been withdrawn, and that of Francis Locke, late a Judge of the Supreme Court, added to the nomination, the latter gentleman was chosen by the following vote... The name of the Judge was held in nomination, not only without his consent, but in violation to his declared wishes. Under all the circumstances, however, he may be induced or rather compelled to serve."  The Raleigh Minerva (Raleigh, NC).  December 30, 1814.</note>
