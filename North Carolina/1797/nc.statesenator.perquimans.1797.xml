				<note resp="Philip Lampi">William Greevy, in certifying the election wrote, "while the commons tickets were calling out, there came out one for Joseph Harvey (the word Senator was not wrote on it) and three for Francis Newby, two of which were wrote at large Francis Newby, Senator; some persons said that they would be good; I then put them under the candlestick, untill all the tickets were called out; I then handed them to one of the Superintendants; after a small space of time Major Joseph Harvey called on the Sheriff to give the casting vote, that he would admit it to be a tye; the Sheriff refused to give the casting vote, and said he should make a special return to the Assembly, and state the facts; the Sheriff then made proclamation that no Senator was elected, or words to that effect."  Original Election Certificate.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Though the Original Election Certificate shows no Senator as elected, when the next session of the Senate began on November 20, Joseph Harvey was seated as "legally elected to represent" Pequimans County.</note>
