				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Joseph Black received a majority of 17 votes.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">A voter sheet gives the following returns:  86 votes for Peter Gilbert; 2 votes for Joseph Black; 1 vote for Patrick Noble; 1 vote for George Bowl; and 1 vote for J. idam.  This could be one of the returns for the above election, or the single return (out of five) of a previous special election which was declared void as it was the only district to be returned.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Joseph Black was elected a Director of the Bank of South Carolina on December 19, 1812, which the house deemed to be a disqualfiying office on September 16, 1813.  Peter Gilbert was elected in a subsequent special election, but was denied his seat because only one of the five polls was opened for the election.  Therefore, a new election was ordered due to a state of partial returns.</note>
