				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The City Gazette and Commercial Advertiser (Charleston, SC) lists 32 votes for both candidates.  Discrepancies in vote totals are a result of partial returns and the dispute over the legality of Elliot's as a voting district; not all districts were accounted for at the time of publication.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Voter list from the Chapel on James Island contain the names of 55 voters. Of these 3 did not vote for Assembly. - Signed by the Managers - John W. Holmes and Rawlin Rivers.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"That twenty four Voters voted for Senator and a Member of the Legislature at the poll held by Samuel P. Elliot - that in the counting the votes after the close of the poll, there were twenty six votes and then the Managers destroyed two votes, to make them correspond with the number of Voters."  Affidavit of Joseph Cole.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Your memorialist (Henry I. Chalmers) represents to your honorable body, that he himself had a majority of eleven over the said William Cattell" - 41 votes for Chalmers, 30 votes for Cattell.  The above which was taken from the Memorial Petition of Mr. Chalmers contesting this election is based on the returns from the above two election precincts (James Island and The Main). A third place of election which Mr. Chalmers contends was illigal caused the election of John Rivers to the House. For this return see the Southern Patriot results of October 12th. As Rivers was listed in the Journals it appears that all three election precincts were counted.</note>
