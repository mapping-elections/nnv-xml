				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The City Gazette lists 30 votes for William Cattell and 41 votes for Henry I. Chalmers (omitting the results from Elliot's polling place).  Discrepancies in vote totals are a result of partial returns and the dispute over the legality of Elliot's as a voting district.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Your memorialist (Henry I. Chalmers) represents to your honorable body, that he himself had a majority of eleven over the said William Cattell" - (41 votes for Chalmers, 30 votes for Cattell).  The above which was taken from the Memorial Petition of Mr. Chalmers contesting this election is based on the returns from the above two election precincts (James Island and The Main).  A third place of election which Mr. Chalmers contends was illigal caused the election of William Cattell to the Senate.   As Cattell was listed in the Journals it appears that all three election precincts were counted.</note>
