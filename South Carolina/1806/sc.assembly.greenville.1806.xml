				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"It appeared on counting the votes, that Mr. Edwards had but two votes more than J. H. Harrison, and on counting the votes for a member of Congress, the next day, three votes were found amongst them for Mr. Harrison, so that he, of right, Elected."  The Times (Charleston, SC).  October 27, 1806.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The results of this election were contested by supporters of John Hampton Harrison, who alleged that several votes for Harrison were mistakenly put in the box for a member of Congress by the managers.  Ultimately, the elections of John Blasingame and Thomas Edwards were upheld.</note>
