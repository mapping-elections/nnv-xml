				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Republican majority would have been 126, for the Senator, had it not been that 107 of the voters from this district were on duty at Hadrill's Point, where they held a poll to try the strength of parties, which eventuated in 88 for the Republican and 19 for the Federal candidate; which, added to the actual return, would have made the Republican majority as above stated.[sic]  It should be observed that Capt. MacKerall was a volunteer on duty at the camp at Hadrill's Point at the time of the election. Great credit is due to the Republicans for their exertions on this occasion; this district never having been completely republicanised before."
