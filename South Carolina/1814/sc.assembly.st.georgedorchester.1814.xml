				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The Committee on Privileges and Elections found that the poll at the lower place of election near Dorchester failed to open due to the death of poll manager, Joseph M. Waring's child.  The other poll manager went to the upper place of election.  The committee believed that John Carr should be able to retain his seat because he had 84 or 85 votes at the upper poll, and even if Charles Ladson had received all of the votes at the lower poll, John Carr still would have had a majority.  However, the house disagreed and declared this election null and void on December 1, 1815.</note>
