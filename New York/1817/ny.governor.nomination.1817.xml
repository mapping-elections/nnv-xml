				<note resp="Philip Lampi">This convention was composed of the Republican members of the Legislature and in those counties where the Federalist held the Assembly seats, County Delegates were chosen by local Republican to attend the Convention so that all the counties were represented. The persons nominated at this Convention would then become the party candidates in the General Election when the Governor, etc. were chosen by popular vote. In 1817 the Federalist did not contest the election for Governor and Lieutenant Governor.</note>
