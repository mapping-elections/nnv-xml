					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Gerrit Y. Lansing, son of the Treasurer, was chosen Clerk, by a majority of six over Solomon Southwick, the former Clerk."  The Albany Register (Albany, NY).  January 29, 1807.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Mr. Southwick, you will see, has five votes more than Dr. Sheldon [the Republican candidate for Speaker of the Assembly]; the reason is that five Republican members arrived and came into the house after we had voted for Speaker and while we were voting for the Clerk. Two republican members are yet absent, namely, Mr. Verbryck of Rockland, and Mr. Gurdon Huntington of Otsego, who are every moment expected."  Republican Watch-Tower (New York, NY).  February 3, 1807.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Two republican members are yet absent from the seat of government; but they are expected every hour. These gentlemen are, Mr. Verbryck, of Rockland, and Mr. Gurdon Huntington, of Otsego [sic]; decidedly friends to correct principle, and declared enemies to the unnatural union of the quids and feds."  The Public Advertiser (New York, NY).  February 2, 1807.</note>
