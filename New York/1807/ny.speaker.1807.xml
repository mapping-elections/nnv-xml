					<note resp="Philip Lampi">The Poughkeepsie Journal, and Constitutional Republican (Poughkeepsie, NY), February 3, the Republican Watch-Tower (New York, NY), February 3, The Public Advertiser (New York, NY), February 2, and the Republican Crisis (Albany, NY), January 29, list 51 votes for Andrew MacCord.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Legislature of this state met at Albany on Tuesday last.  The House of Assembly proceeded to the choice of a speaker - Mr. MacCord had 53 votes and was chosen.  The Clintonian candidate had 40.  Two votes were lost, owing to a mistake in writing Mr. MacCord's name."  The True American and Commercial Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA).  February 4, 1807.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"It will be seen that the votes given for Speaker were 51 to 40; one vote for Mr. MacCord was lost by his christian name being spelt, by mistake, Adam instead of Andrew, which makes 52 to 40, and there was one blank vote."  Republican Crisis (Albany, NY).  January 29, 1807.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Andrew MacCord was chosen speaker by a majority of 11--the votes were 53 to 40--2 were illegal being for Adam MacCord."  New-York Herald (New York, NY).  February 4, 1807.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Mr. Southwick [the Republican candidate for Clerk of Assembly], you will see, has five votes more than Dr. Sheldon; the reason is that five Republican members arrived and came into the house after we had voted for Speaker and while we were voting for the Clerk. Two republican members are yet absent, namely, Mr. Verbryck of Rockland, and Mr. Gurdon Huntington of Otsego, who are every moment expected."  Republican Watch-Tower (New York, NY).  February 3, 1807.</note>
