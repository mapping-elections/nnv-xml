           <note resp="Philip Lampi">The Public Advertiser (New York, NY), November 29, lists John O'Neal with the party designation Quid. The issue of November 30 lists him as a Federalist with the following remarks: "Mr. O'Neal was placed on the federal ticket and met with their full and hearty support. He was run on the Quid ticket.--These facts are well understood. Lewis Angevine a federalist, was dropped by his party to make room for the favorite O'Neal! Mr. Peterson also declined standing for collector, in order to throw the weight of his influence into the scale of the two-sided candidate, against Mr. J. Mooney, the candidate of the regular nomination. Peterson the former republican collector was displeased and chagrined because of the nomination of Mr. Mooney. The republicans for their collector had to contend with federalism, faction, and Peterson's apostate friends. This cannot be contradicted."  In both issues, John O'Neal is listed as John O. Neal in the list of returns.  Thomas Mooney is referred to as J. Mooney in the remarks.</note>
