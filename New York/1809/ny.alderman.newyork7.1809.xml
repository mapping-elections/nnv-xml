           <note resp="Philip Lampi">"CHARTER ELECTION. THE result has been such as was to have been expected. If republicans will labor to destroy themselves, who will save them? ... We have carried the 5th and 10th wards--we have come within 5 votes of electing our candidate in the 4th ward. In the third we were united, and obtained our accustomed number. But in the sixth, seventh and eighth wards the republicans presented two tickets; and what is the consequence?--a total defeat.  Let us make a reflection on this subject. One part of the republican body insisted on substituting new candidates in the place of the old, and others refused to abandon men whom they alledged deserved well of the party. Neither side would yield; and if accomodation was offered it was rejected, under the vain idea that they could do without each other. ... The ballot-box has shewn that neither section can succeed without the aid of the other. ... The federalists by our divisions have obtained a triumph even in our strong holds. ...  One of the People."  The Columbian (New York, NY).  November 27, 1809.</note>
