				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The triumph of Federalism in the county of Green. Whatever may have been the result of the election in other parts of the state, the FEDERAL REPUBLICANS of the county of Greene, have the satisfaction to reflect, that they have in a good measure done their duty. They have expressed by their suffrages, their detestation of those measures, which have brought our government to the very verge of dissolution.  The triumph of Federalism, was celebrated in this village on Friday with every expression of joy which so pleasing an event could inspire.  I would, however, express my regret, that the procession formed on the occasion was led by their file leader to the doors of some of our political opponents with some expressions of triumph. This was not done in pursuance of any previous arrangement, and I presume to say met with the decided disapprobation of most of the gentlemen who formed the procession. As an individual I had no disposition to triumph over the vanquished. The sentiments which the occasion inspired were in their nature more noble -- more honorable. They were such as arose from the reflection, that truth had triumphed over falsehood -- correct principles over a mistaken and corrupt policy."  American Eagle (Catskill, NY).  May 3, 1809.</note>
