           <note resp="Philip Lampi">"New York, Nov. 28  There was a trifling omission in the return of the late city election, published in this paper on Saturday. Mr. Ward the Madisonian candidate had 87 votes in the 8th ward. With this correction then it appears, that the whole number of federal votes in the city was 3928; whole number of democratic votes 3498; Leaving a clear federal majority of 430."

           <note resp="Philip Lampi">Other than the mention of an ommission by The True American and Commercial Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA), November 30, only The Columbian (New York, NY) lists Jasper Ward as a candidate in Ward 8 and it identifies him as Madisonian.</note>
           <note resp="Philip Lampi">"In Saturday's Post, Mr. [illegible], stating the result of the election, omits [illegible] the third candidate in the 8th ward, and the number of votes he got. His views in this [illegible] must be inferred from his conduct, [illegible] intended to give a fair representation [illegible] of the ward, and of the two republicans in the three wards wherein they were divided, he ought to have published them, in his own style, as: ."  The Columbian (New York, NY).  November 27, 1809.</note>
           <note resp="Philip Lampi">"CHARTER ELECTION.  THE result has been such as was to have been expected. If republicans will labor to destroy themselves, who will save them? ...  We have carried the 5th and 10th wards--we have come within 5 votes of electing our candidate in the 4th ward. In the third we were united, and obtained our accustomed number. But in the sixth, seventh and eighth wards the republicans presented two tickets; and what is the consequence?--a total defeat.  Let us make a reflection on this subject. One part of the republican body insisted on substituting new candidates in the place of the old, and others refused to abandon men whom they alledged deserved well of the party. Neither side would yield; and if accomodation was offered it was rejected, under the vain idea that they could do without each other. ... The ballot-box has shewn that neither section can succeed without the aid of the other. ... The federalists by our divisions have obtained a triumph even in our strong holds. ...  One of the People."  The Columbian (New York, NY).  November 27, 1809.</note>
