				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"To the Editor -- Albany, Feb. 7.  I hasten to give you the result of our proceedings relative to the choice of a Senator in the place of Dr. Mitchill.  Understanding in caucus that the Mayor would not serve, Gen. O. German was nominated by a majority. Mr. Foot, another republican, who was very respectably supported, is pleased with the choice. The caucus assembled at nine this morning, and the choice was to be made in the Assembly at 12...Our sound country opinions, you see, the good old republican ones, will prevail."  Republican Watch-Tower (New York, NY).  February 14, 1809.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"To the Editor -- Albany, Feb. 7.  This morning the Legislature elected GENERAL OBADIAH GERMAN United States Senator for six years after the 4th March next. Laus Deo! GERMAN you well know. He is a republican of the old school. He was and is, as every body knows in the Legislature and out of it, a prominent CLINTONIAN, and a most decided enemy to every thing in politics that looks like disorganization.  N.B. General German nominated in caucus Mr. De Witt Clinton to succeed Dr. Mitchill, who would have been elected had he not declined. Ebenezer Foot, Esq. one of our distinguished republicans, was powerfully supported in caucus by a great number of our most respectable friends."  Republican Watch-Tower (New York, NY).  February 14, 1809.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Legislature have chosen OBADIAH GERMAN, Esq. to represent this state in the Senate of the U. States, for six years from the 4th of March next, when the time of Doctor Mitchill expires. We understand, that the nomination of Gen. German was not predicated on any distrust of the integrity or want of respect for the talents of our learned and highly esteemed friend, Dr. Mitchill; but that a majority of the members conceived, that the Western District, from its growing population and that District presents few men who have been more active or useful in the cause of their country than Gen. German. The votes in the Assembly were, for German 49--Mitchill 7--Brooks (federalist) 42. In the Senate, German 16--Mitchill 9--Brooks 1."  The Albany Register (Albany, NY).  February 10, 1809.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"General Obadiah German, is elected a senator of the United States, for the state of New York, for six years, ensuing the 3rd of March next, in the place of Dr. Mitchell, the term of whose appointment on that day expires. Mr. German had 65; Mr. Brooks 43 and Dr. Mitchell 16."  The Republican (Savannah GA).  March 2, 1809.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Resolved, That Obadiah German, of the town of Norwich, in the county of Chenango, Esquire, be and he is hereby duly nominated and appointed a senator to represent this state in the senate of the congress of the United States for the term of six years commencing with the fourth day of March next."
