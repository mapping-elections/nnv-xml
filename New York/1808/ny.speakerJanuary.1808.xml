					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Legislature of this state convened on Thursday last agreeably to law.  In the House of Assembly the Hon. Alexander Sheldon was chosen Speaker, without any systematic opposition. The restoration of Mr. Sheldon to the Speaker's chair, from which he was excluded last year by a deluded majority, is an event gratifying to the feelings of his particular friends, important to the republican interest, and will be highly conducive to the dispatch of business and the preservation of order in the House. What we remarked last year, when contrasting Mr. Sheldon with his anti-republican, though successful competitor, we now repeat that no Speaker, since we have had any knowledge of the councils of the state, has discharged the duties of his station with equal ability, or with more firmness and impartiality."
