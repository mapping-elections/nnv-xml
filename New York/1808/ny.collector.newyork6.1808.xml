           <note resp="Philip Lampi">The New-York Commercial Advertiser (New York, NY) and New-York Spectator (New York, NY) use the name T. O'Neale for John O'Neale, and identify him as a Quid.

           <note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Sixth Ward canvas -- As an application will be made to the Common Council of this city to set aside the late charter election in the 6th ward, for irregularity of conduct in the Inspectors of the election, it may not be improper to call the attention of the community to the law and the facts upon which the application will be grounded. In doing this, however, neither party considerations nor the opposing candidates will be regarded. We come forward in behalf of the rights of the people and the supremacy of the law. Nor will improper motives be imputed to the inspectors : not a doubt is entertained of the purity of their intentions. The allegation merely is, that misinterpreting the statute of the state 'relative to the election of Charter officers,' the conduct of the Inspectors has not been conformable to it."  American Citizen (New York, NY).  November 21, 1808.</note>
