           <note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Annual Election of Town Officers for the City of Albany, was held on Tuesday last -- In the first and third wards there was no opposition to the Federal candidates -- In the second there was a warm contest for several of the candidates -- and in the fourth two full tickets were supported -- the contest was long and animated -- every inch of ground was disputed -- the result was however most decidedly for the Federal candidates in both wards. A state of the poll is given."  The Albany Gazette (Albany, NY).  May 5, 1808.</note>
