           <note resp="Philip Lampi">"The federalists of this city claim a victory, because our majority in the charter election is smaller than it was last year. But it should be remembered that in the county election, a month after the town meeting last year, there was a federal majority for the assembly ticket of 31, and that this year they have had the embargo to add to their electionering weapons. Let them make what they will of it, we are perfectly satisfied with the result."  The Bee (Hudson, NY).  April 12, 1808.</note>
