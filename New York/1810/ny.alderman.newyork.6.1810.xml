				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Owing to the loss of difference of forty ballots less than the number of electors, who names were inserted in the poll lists, neither party can take the sixth ward into calculation, as this error leaves the election undecided.  It is probable, however, when the new election takes place, that ward will be added to the republican side."  Public Advertiser (New York, NY).  November 24, 1810.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"We understand that the election of the federal candidates in the 6th and 9th wards will be contested on good and substantital grounds; and if our information is correct, the returns of the 6th ward will be laid aside, and a new election ordered, and in the 9th the republican assitant will be allowed his seat.  As a short time, however, will determine the issue, we forbear any further elucidation or comment."  The Columbian (New York, NY).  November 24, 1810.</note>
