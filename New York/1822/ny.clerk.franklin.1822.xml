				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The initial reports for Franklin County only gave the returns from four towns, which were not named. Those totals were given as: Asa Wheeler 322 votes, Ebenezer Brownson 276 votes. When the Official Returns were reported, it was noted that 'The votes of Dickinson and Bangor were lost.' It appears, based on the first partial reports that the votes from one or both of these towns were included in those results. In 1822 there were six towns in Franklin County."</note>
