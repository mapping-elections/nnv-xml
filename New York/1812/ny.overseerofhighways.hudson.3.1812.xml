           <note resp="Philip Lampi">The Northern Whig (Hudson, NY) alleges several instances of malfeasance on the part of the Republicans in the charter elections (the city's mayor was Republican). These include the disenfranchisment of ten black men who had regularly voted in previous elections; the practice of allowing soldiers stationed in the city to vote; and the instance that some minors had been permitted to vote.</note>
           <note resp="Philip Lampi">"In the first place, the federalists lost this election by the necessary absence of seven federalists, attending as party and as witness in a suit in the Circuit Court of the U States, then sitting in the city of New York. -- The votes of these persons would have carried in every candidate on the federal ticket."  Northern Whig (Hudson, NY).  April 13, 1812.</note>
