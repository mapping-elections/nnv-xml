				<note resp="Philip Lampi">According to the census figures for 1810, New York was entitled to gain seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. However, the State Legislature did not re-apportion the Congressional districts before the elections scheduled for the spring. Therefore, elections for U.S. House of Representatives were held using the previous district boundaries. The results of these elections were declared null and void. A newly elected State Legislature redrew the districts and set the dates of December 15-17 for new Congressional elections.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Not all counties held elections for U.S. House of Representatives during the spring cycle, since it was known that districts were slated to be redrawn.</note>
