					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"From Our Correspondent  Albany, Tuesday, January 28, 1812  The Legislature assembled to-day, and proceeded to business.  One hundred and five members appeared in the house, were qualified, and took their seats ... Samuel North, Esq. was unanimously re-elected clerk."  New-York Herald (New York, NY).  February 1, 1812.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Tuesday, January 28, 1812. This day the legislature assembled. On the call of the house, 105 members appeared, were qualified, and took their seats. The house then proceeded to the choice of a speaker, when Dr. Alexander Sheldon, of Montgomery, was elected almost unanimously, there being but 4 scattering votes. Samuel North esq. was unanimously re-elected clerk; Thomas Donnelly, sergeant at arms, and Benjamin Whipple, door-keeper.  These appointments give general satisfaction, and the unanimity of the house in them is equally flattering to their discernment, and to the acknowledged qualifications of the gentlemen appointed."  The Columbian (New York, NY).  February 3, 1812.</note>
