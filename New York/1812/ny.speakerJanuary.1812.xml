					<note resp="Philip Lampi">In New York in 1812, there were two legislative sessions, one commencing in January, the second in November. As a result, there were two elections for legislative officers (Speaker, Clerk, etc.).</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"From Our Correspondent  Albany, Tuesday, January 28, 1812  The Legislature assembled to-day, and proceeded to business.  One hundred and five members appeared in the house, were qualified, and took their seats.  Dr. Sheldon, of Montgomery, was chosen Speaker, almost unanimously, there being but 4 scattering votes."  New-York Herald (New York, NY).  February 1, 1812.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"From our Albany Correspondent.  Mr. Lewis, Both houses formed a quorum this day. Dr. Sheldon was chosen Speaker without opposition; and Mr. North clerk."  New-York Spectator (New York, NY).  February 1, 1812.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Tuesday, January 28, 1812. This day the legislature assembled. On the call of the house, 105 members appeared, were qualified, and took their seats. The house then proceeded to the choice of a speaker, when Dr. Alexander Sheldon, of Montgomery, was elected almost unanimously, there being but 4 scattering votes. Samuel North esq. was unanimously re-elected clerk; Thomas Donnelly, sergeant at arms, and Benjamin Whipple, door-keeper.  These appointments give general satisfaction, and the unanimity of the house in them is equally flattering to their discernment, and to the acknowledged qualifications of the gentlemen appointed."  The Columbian (New York, NY).  February 3, 1812.</note>
