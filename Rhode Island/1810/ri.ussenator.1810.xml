				<note resp="Philip Lampi">This was a very controversial election, in that the Governor cast his vote as a member of the Legislature in what was called the "General Session". Normally when the Legislature voted for United States Senators, only the Lower House (Representatives) and the Upper House (Senators) were allowed to vote. However, in this case the Governor was permitted to vote. The Republican members asserted that as head of state he was technically part of the Legislature and that since there was a tie vote, his right to vote was encompassed in his range of duties. There was considerable debate about this, especially since the Governor had been elected without opposition the past three years and had the support of both parties and was considered, politically, to be an independent.  The Governor's vote decided the election for the Republican candidate, but there was a toll to be paid, for in the Spring elections of 1811, the Governor and all the other Republicans candidates for State Offices were defeated by the Federalists.  They would maintain complete control of the state until 1818.</note>
