					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The votes for Peter Ambler were given by the federalists.  They had again and again solicited several of the democrats to unite in the support of Mr. Ambler but all without effect.  Still in hopes of dividing and drawing off some of the democrats, they voted for Mr. A. contrary to his will or wishes.  In justice to Mr. Ambler it ought to be stated, that he is a Baptist by profession and an undeviating republican; that he served his country from the commencement to the close of the revolutionary war; and that he and his four sons came forward and supported the toleration ticket, and that he most heartily despises the contemptible tricks of expiring federalism."
