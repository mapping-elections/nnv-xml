				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Town clerk was chosen by a majority of 38 votes.  Moses Seymour, Esq. was chosen, who is claimed by the Democrats, to be of their party.  We are not at present disposed to dispute titles with our Democratic friends for the Town-Clerk; but we may be allowed to observce, that he owes his election to a number of Federalists, who voted for him because he had been a long time in the office, and because he claims for himself to be a very moderate man, and sometimes to be of no party."  Litchfield Monitor (Litchfield, CT).  November 12, 1806.</note>
