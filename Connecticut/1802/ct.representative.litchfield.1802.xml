				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Most of the town in Connecticut send two representative to the general assembly. The mode of election is as follows: the freemen, or persons qualified to vote, being assembled, are called upon by the presiding officer of the meeting to deliver their ballot for their first representative. If no one is found to have a majority of the whole number of votes given in, it is declared to be no choice, and the freemen are called to ballot a second time for first representative, and so continue balloting until a choice is effected by a major vote. In like manner the second representative is chosen."  The Bee (Hudson, NY).  December 14, 1802.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"At the first ballot for first representative Mr. Kirby had 17 more votes than Mr. Morris, but there were 17 scattering votes, some of which were for Mr. Oliver Wolcott, and some for Mr. Seymour; of course there was no choice. A second ballot was ordered, and Mr. Kirby was elected."  The Bee (Hudson, NY).  December 14, 1802.</note>
