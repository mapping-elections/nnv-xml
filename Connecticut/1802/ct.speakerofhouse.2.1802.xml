				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"On Thursday the 14th inst. the General Assembly of Connecticut convened at New-Haven.  On balloting for Speaker in the House of Representatives, the whole number of votes was 153; of this number, Ephraim Kirby, Esq. had at two successive trials, 30!! - at the third 27!!! . . . It is surprising that out of 78 democratic members which our democratic brethren, have advertised to all the world as having been chosen to the Legislature this fall, only 36 should have been present at the meeting of Assembly.  We must suppose that the 42 absent members of that 'Sect' have some pique against the Leader of the party, or they would have been more punctual."  Connecticut Courant (Hartford, CT).  October 18, 1802.</note>
