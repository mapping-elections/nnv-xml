				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"On Friday afternoon both houses of the Legislation were convened in Joint meeting for the purpose of appointing a Governor and sundry Clerks of the pleas.  Three candidates for the office of Governor had been placed on nomination by the democrats, William S. Pennington, Joseph Bloomfield, and William Russell, and by the Federalists, one candidate, Aaron Ogden.  A caucus, as usual, of the prevailing party was held the night preceeding the joint-meeting, to determine who should be governor.  We understand that the eastern and western democrats divided as to the person who should succeed the present governor.  Neither, it seems wanted him continued, but each party determined not to resign its favorite man.  Thus situated it was finally concluded to let the old governor go in once more and give up contention.  On the opening of the joint-meeting, an eastern democrat withdrew Judge Pennington's name, and a western democrat that of Judge Russell; whereupon Mr. Parker withdrew Col. Ogden's and Governor Bloomfield was re-appointed without opposition." The Trenton Federalist (Trenton, NJ).  October 30, 1809.</note>
