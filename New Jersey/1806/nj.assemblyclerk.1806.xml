				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The relative strength of parties in the House Of Assembly, was decided on Tuesday last in the choice of a Speaker and Clerk, -- The Republicans nominated James Cox, Esq. for Speaker and the Federalist nominated William Coxe Esq.for the same office. On taking the question, the votes were as follow: .... Neither of the Candidates voted; and Mr. Willits, of Cape May, a federalist, and Mr. Clark of Gloucester, a Republican, were absent. So the parties are divided as we stated in our last, 22 Republicans to 18 Federalist."  The True American (Trenton, NJ).  November 3, 1806.</note>
