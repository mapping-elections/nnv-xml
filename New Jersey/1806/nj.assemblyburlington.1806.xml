				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"As far as our information extends, the following counties have returned full federal representations to the Legislature, viz. Bergen, Middlesex, Somerset, Burlington, Gloucester and Cape-May. The representation from Sussex and Cumberland will be divided. The important change which has taken place the year past in favour of WASHINGTON POLICY, in New Jersey, is highly honorable to the people of the state. American men and American measures are evidently coming again into fashion. The persecuting men who for a time past have swayed our Councils and pulled down the old faithful Friends of the People who stood the brunt of our Revolutionary contest with Great-Britain, for the purpose of putting into power young men and factious foreigners who have lately come among us to disturb our peace and eat our substance, must now give way to the Friends of Free Government and Liberty of Conscience. ... In Burlington the Federal majority with very little exertion was increased from 2 to about 500 votes."  Trenton Federalist (Trenton, NJ).  October 27, 1806.</note>
