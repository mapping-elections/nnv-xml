Wilson. Mr. Read stated that he had nominated Mr. Elmer and asked leave to withdraw his name - which was granted. The question was then taken between the two remaining Candidates - when all the Federal Members voted for Mr. Lambert and all the Republican Members voted for Mr. Wilson and the latter was declared to be duly elected."
