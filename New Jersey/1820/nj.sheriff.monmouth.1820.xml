				<note resp="Philip Lampi">During the times when party rivalry was very intense, each party would usually hold a county (state, district, etc.) caucus to nominate and or select a county (state or district) ticket. The caucus was usually composed of delegates from each of the townships (or counties). The tickets nominated or selected at these caucus's were usually voted for by the parties and there was generally a high degree of what is termed "bloc voting". However, after 1815 in New Jersey the tight party cohesion began to loosen and the caucus lost some of its importance and appeal. Although it was still used by both parties for the more competitive counties, in those counties where the elections were no longer strictly party battles, the caucus became somewhat ineffective and often aroused anger and discontent within some counties, due to what was perceived as unfair regional representation or personality differences among the candidates. As a result, candidates would often run as opponents of the caucus nominations, which is apparently what happened in Monmouth County in the 1820 election. Is seems that the Republican caucus had nominated a slate of Assembly candidates and a person for Sheriff. However, some Republicans and most likely many Federalists cast their votes for other Republican candidates not endorsed by the caucus and were able to defeat two of the Caucus candidates, and in a rather surprising circumstance, they also elected a Federalist as Sheriff.</note>
