				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"NEW-BRUNSWICK Oct. 29 ... Extract of a letter from a gentleman in W. Jersey to his correspondent in this city, dated Oct. 21, 1800.  It is with peculiar pleasure I now inform you, that the federal ticket has succeeded, in toto, in the counties of Gloucester, Salem, Cumberland and Cape May.  Unusual, and almost inconceivable exertions were made by both parties, for a long time before, and during the election. The exertions in this township (Woolwich) were worthy of the cause -- 450 votes were taken, 88 more than ever received before; and what adds to their value is, that only the pitiful number of 15 were devoted to Jefferson, irreligion and anarchy. Jacobinism, you observe, does not thrive in our soil."  The Philadelphia Gazette and Daily Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA).  October 30, 1800.</note>
