                <note resp="Philip Lampi">Returns for Bergen, Cape May, and Salem counties have not been located. As of a week before the election it was not known if the Federalist Party would support a ticket in Bergen County. The Centinel of Freedom (Newark, NJ), which usually reported the votes from Bergen County did not publish any returns in their election coverage for 1823; an indication that perhaps the Republican ticket ran unopposed.</note>
