                <note resp="Philip Lampi">Returns for Bergen, Cape May, and Salem counties have not been located. Nominations to the Council and Assembly for Cape May County appear in both the Bridgeton Observer and the Washington Whig (Bridgeton, NJ). However, as was usually the custom, most of those nominated eventually declined before the election. John L. Smith was the only recognized Republican among those nominated for Council and had been a candidate for that office on several previous occasions. Joshua Swain, the Federalist candidate for Council, was elected.</note>
