                <note resp="Philip Lampi">Nominations to the Council and Assembly for Cape May County appear in both the Bridgeton Observer and the Washington Whig (Bridgeton, NJ). However, as was usually the custom, most of those nominated eventually declined before the election. Cresse Townsend was the only recognized Republican among those nominated for Council and had been a candidate for that office on several previous occasions. Thomas H. Hughes, the Federalist candidate for Council, was elected.</note>
