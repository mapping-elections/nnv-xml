				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Returns of Salem County. Salem, 17th October, 1803. Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to inform you that in the County of Salem Republicanism has compleatly triumphed over anarchy; those who call themselves Federalists played all their old tricks, notwithstanding which at the close of the Poll the Votes stood as follows ... Thus you see that notwithstanding all the calumny poured forth against the Republicans throughout the state, we have a handsome majority; far greater than at any former period, and we have satisfactory assurances, that the state is completely Republicanized."  The True American (Trenton, NJ).  October 24, 1803.</note>
