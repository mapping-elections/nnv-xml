				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The annual election for members of Council and General Assembly of this State is over; and with pride we say, the cause of truth, of virtue, and of freedom has triumphed with more than ordinary success. Generally speaking, the federal opposition this year has been extremely feeble. In counties where their strength has been tried, and where even their candidates have been sucessful, the results by no means dishonorable to republicanism; it annually acquires strength, and shortly it must and will predominate ... In Somerset, a county hitherto decidedly federal, the old members are turned out, and the republican candidates are elected by handsome majorities."  The Centinel of Freedom (Newark, NJ).  October 23, 1804.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"We are happy in announcing to our Readers, that in Somerset County the Republicans have succeeded in electing their Candidates for Council, Assembly, and Sheriff.--This success is highly gratifyng in itself as it evinces the continued progress of correct principles in the state, and adds strength to the supporters of those principles in the Legislature--and it is peculiarly pleasing as it was in a great measure unexpected. We hope, and trust, that Somerset, having thus resumed her Republican station, will not fall asleep and suffer herself to be shorn of her locks by the Philistines of our day."  The True American (Trenton, NJ).  October 22, 1804.</note>
