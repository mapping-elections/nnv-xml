        <note resp="Philip Lampi">Henry Clay was re-elected in 1812 [13th Congress]. In early 1814 he was appointed Minister, or Envoy to Great Britain and resigned his Congressional seat on January 19, 1814 and there was a special election in February 1814 to pick his replacement. He was still out of the country in August 1814 when he decided again to be a candidate to the 14th Congress. He was elected, but since he was still in England, the Governor of Kentucky who was unsure of the Constitutional issues involving Henry Clay holding two federal offices issued a writ for a new election, thereby vacating the seat to which Clay had been elected in 1814. The special election, which was still for the 14th Congress was held on October 30, 1815 and Henry Clay was elected without opposition. Henry Clay returned to the United States in early October and apparently after being elected again to Congress he was able to resume his Congressional duties.</note>
