				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Although elected at-large, Georgia's members had to be residents of specific districts that were established by the same law.  Each voter in casting three votes had to cast one vote for a candidate residing in each of these districts. The statewide totals determined who was elected from each district."  United States Congressional Elections, 1788-1997.  3.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Parties as yet were not really organized in Georgia.  George Mathews would later become Governor and under his administration occurred the Yazoo land speculation scandals, many of which were linked to notable Georgia Federalists.  Francis Willis seems a maverick, although mildly Republican, he was almost independent of politics.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The General Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA) of March 12, 1792 lists 268 votes for Francis Willis and 248 votes for George Matthews.</note>
