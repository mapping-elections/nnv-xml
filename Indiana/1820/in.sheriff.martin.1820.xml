				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The election of Shirley was disallowed by the county commissioners on the grounds that he had not been a resident of the county for the required twelve months although the county was not definitely established until February 1, 1820.  No return has been found covering the special election ordered and no commission for a sheriff is recorded for this year, but Julius Johnson was present as sheriff when the county commissioners met on November 14, 1820, and subsequently."
