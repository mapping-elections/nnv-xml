                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"The last exciting contest between the Juntos and the Brimstones was held on the 14th day of October, 1823.  The election was for a justice of the peace.  Alexander McConnel and Timothy Gaylord were the aspirants for magisterial honors.  Alexander McConnel received forty-eight votes, and Timothy Gaylord forty.  This was a decisive triumph for the Juntos.  The presidential contest coming on in the next year, 1824, the "Brimstone and Junto" partisans were to some extent lost in that memorable contest.  Breaking loose from former political associations, "Brimstones" and "Juntos" were found working harmoniously together for some one of the presidential candidates.  Politics then, as now, made "strange bedfellows."  McConnel and Gaylord, who twelve months before were engaged in a bitter strife over the insignificant office of a justice of the peace upon the "Junto" and "Brimstone" platforms, were found working harmoniously together for the election of Clay, and four years later both were prominent Jacksonians."
