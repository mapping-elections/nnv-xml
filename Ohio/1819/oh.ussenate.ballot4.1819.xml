				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"W.A. Trimble of Highland County, Ohio, is elected a Senator in Congress for six years from and after the 3rd of March next, when will expire the term of Mr. Morrow, who declines re-election. There were three ballots before an election by the Legislature, the results of which were as follows:"  National Intelligencer (Washington, DC).  February 12, 1819.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The election took place on January 30.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"An election was held of a successor to Jeremiah Morrow as U.S. Senator.  Gov. Worthington was the logical candidate of the Republicans, being by far their ablest and most influential man, but the factions of the party were at work against him, and united on Col. William A. Trimble of Hillsboro, who represented that section in the State Senate, and whose only qualification for the office was that he had been frightfully wounded in the battle of Fort Erie a few years before."
