					<note resp="Philip Lampi">This election was contested because a separate poll sheet was found, but not included in the original totals.  The votes from the separate poll gave Abner Lord 11 additional votes, Joseph Spencer 11 additional votes, Hugh Phelps 39 additional votes and John G. Henderson 39 additional votes.  If the two polls had both been counted the totals would have been Abner Lord = 69, Joseph Spencer = 66, Hugh Phelps = 89 and John G. Henderson = 87, thereby changing the result of the election.</note>
