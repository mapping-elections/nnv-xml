				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The election of Senator to supply the place of Mr. Giles, or rather of Mr. Eppes, has excited an unusual degree of interest in the Virginia Legislature.  The candidates were, Gen. Armistead T. Mason, of Loudon; Col. John Mercer of Fredericksburg, and Mr. James Pleasants, now in Congress."  The Telescope (Columbia, S.C.).  January 16, 1816.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Senate however receded, and another ballot was had, when General Mason was elected, he having eighty-nine votes, Mr. Mercer eighty-seven."  The American Beacon and Commercial Diary (Norfolk, VA).  January 5, 1816.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"There were two ballots rolled up in one for Mason, which were not counted.  He was consequently declared duly elected."  The American Beacon and Commercial Diary (Norfolk, VA).  January 5, 1816.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">This election was summarily declared void.  The House of Delegates declared: "The House of Delegates  having decided, that its adjournment of yesterday before the examination of  the ballots, and ascertainment of the result of the Election of Senator to  the Congress of the United States, to supply the vacancy occasioned by the  resignation of William B. Giles and declension of John W. Eppes, to accept  that office, appointed, by the joint Resolution of the Senate and House of  Delegates, to take place on yesterday, prevented the execution of that Order;  and consequently, that no Report from the Committee appointed to examine the  ballots can now be received."  They then announced "Resolved, That this House will, on  Wednesday the third instant, proceed, by joint ballot with the Senate, to the  election of a Senator in the Congress of the United States, to supply the said  vacancy."</note>
