				<note resp="Philip Lampi">To fill the vacancy of Richard Brent who was elected U.S. Senator.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"It is with sincere regret we announce the death of Bernard Hooe, Jun. Esq. of Prince-William county, Virginia. In consequence of an affray which had taken place between that gentleman and a Mr. Kemp, of the same county, a challenge ensued, and the parties met on the Maryland shore on Friday morning last, and on the first fire both were wounded ~ Mr. Hooe's proved mortal and he expired the same evening. Thus has an amiable woman been suddenly deprived of an affectionate husband, a large family of children of a tender parent, and the community of one of its most valuable members, by that stigma upon civilzed society, the practice of Dueling."  Alexandria Daily Gazette, Commercial and Political (Alexandria, VA).  October 18, 1809.</note>
