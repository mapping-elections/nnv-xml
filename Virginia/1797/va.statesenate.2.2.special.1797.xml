				<note resp="Philip Lampi">David Clarke was elected in 1795 and would have been up for re-election in 1798. I can only assume that for some reason he did not serve out his full term, and there was a special election to fill his vacancy. If Peter Johnson won this special election, he apparently did not run for the Senate seat in the regular scheduled election in 1798, but opted instead to be a candidate for the House of Delegates. It is also possible that I misread the hand writing and George Covington is actually George Carrington, who was chosen a State Senator from this district in the 1798 election. Perhaps he also won the Special election of December 27, 1797 and was then re-elected to the regular term in 1798."</note>
