				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Yesterday the Election was held for a Delegate from this Borough, to the next General Assembly.  No candidate appeared upon the bench, but is was understood that George Loyall would serve, should he be elected by the people.  At a hour, George W. Camp was unexpectedly started, in opposition to Mr. L. as we learn, without his consent, or even an understanding that he would serve if elected.  The public being unapprized that there would be any opposition to Mr. Loyall, very few votes were polled. "  The American Beacon and Commercial Diary (Norfolk, VA).  April 28, 1818.</note>
