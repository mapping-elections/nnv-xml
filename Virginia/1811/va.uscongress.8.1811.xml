				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The Commitee of Elections: "The result of such examination and comparison is that deduction from both polls, the person challenged who do not appear to have been qualified to vote according to the land list of 1810, Taliaferro has a majority over Hungerford of 121 votes."</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Twelfth Congress, 1811-1813.  Committee on Elections. Mr. Findley...Pleasants...Sturges...Emot...Macon...Fisk...Trou (1) John Taliaferro vs. John P. Hungerford, Virginia. Illegal votes. Land lists as evidence. Seat given to petitioner.  The sitting member received a majority of 6 votes on the returns, but an examination of the land lists showed a large number of votes cast for both candidates by persons whose names did not apear on the land lists.  If all these votes should be deducted petitioner would have a majority of 121 votes.  The committee held that the land lists were conclusive only in the absence of all other testimony, and that it was competent for the parties to establish or overthrow the right of persons to vote by other evidence that they were or were not freeholders.   The petitioner had, on May 7 and 28, given the sitting member notice of his intention to contest the eletion, and on September 27 given notice to take testimony on October  10, 17, and 22.  The testimony was taken, but the sitting member refused to attend.  He asked for further time to take testimony, which request was opposed by the petitioner on the ground that he had already had a reasonable time.  The committee held that he could not have been expected to procure his testimony before the petitioner had taken his, and, as time then remaining before the session of Congress was insufficient, recommended the postponement.  The House refused to grant the request and, by a vote of 66 to 19, gave the seat to the petitioner."
