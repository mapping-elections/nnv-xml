				<note resp="Philip Lampi">This election fell to the Executive Council because the State Legislature which usually made these appointments was not in session. It appears that when this situtation arose, the Executive Council was responsible for making the appointments.  The State Legislature did not convene until December 5, 1808 and the election mentioned took place on October 10, 1808.</note>
