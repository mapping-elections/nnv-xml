						<note resp="Philip Lampi">Note on alternative numbers cited in Poll Book: Often on the outside cover of the Poll Books would be written the returns. I think this was done to make it easy for people who might want quick access to the vote without having to go through all the pages with the actual names of the people who voted. It may have also been a privacy issue, as you could tell from the poll books for whom a person voted.  In this case there was a slight variation in the returns on the cover of the poll book and those inside that showed the final tally. Also what might have happened is that the people doing the recording may have remembered that they had not voted and counted their votes at the last without entering their names into the poll book.</note>
