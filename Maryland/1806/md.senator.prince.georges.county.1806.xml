					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"They further report, that Edward Henry Calvert is also returned elected as an elector of the senate, but it appears to your committee from the duplicate return, that Edward H. Calvert had 604 votes, and William Lyles had 603 votes . . . it was proclaimed by one of the judges that the time would expire in one or two minutes, and for voters to come forward; that no voters offering to vote the pols were closed; that afterwards they were opened at the instance and solicitation of Mr. George Clavert, and 5 votes were taken, which were entered upon one of the books of the polls, but not on the other; that it appears by the witnesses, that two of the voters voted for Edward H. Calvert and William Somerville, and two voted for Walter Bowie and William Lyles; that it does not appear for whom the fifth voter voted."  Republican Advocate (Fredericktown, MD).  September 26, 1806.</note>
