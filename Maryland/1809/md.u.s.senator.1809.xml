				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Senator- The House of Delegates, as appeared in last evening's Gazette, have determined to elect a Senator, in the place of Gen. Smith by a separate vote of each branch of the Legislature, as laws are enacted; and they elected Col. Howard, we are informed, by a majority of six: yeas 41, noes 35. This vote was sent to Senate for their concurrance yesterday. We have received no subsequent advices from Annapolis. But it is nearly certain that the Senate, preferring a joint vote, will refuse their assent to the plan of the House. We may every day expect to hear of the Legislature having adjourned, leaving the appointment of a temporary Senator to the new Governor."  The True American and Commercial Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA).  June 13, 1809.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The committee on the part of the House lists that, in conjunction with the gentlemen appointed on the part of the Senate, they had duly received and counted the ballots; the results of which was, that... on the annunciation, by the Speaker of the House of Delegates, that Samuel Smith, of Baltimore, was duly elected Senator for the State of Maryland in the Senate of the United States,- the House adjourned." The Hornet (Fredericktown, Md.).  November 29, 1809.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"General Smith was this day elected to the Senate of the United States, 53 democratic votes to 29 feds. which were for John E. Howard, maugre all the malice of the tory faction. No debate took place on the election."  The Whig (Baltimore, MD).  November 15, 1809.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Triumph of Republicanism Complete- Yesterday according to the resolves of both houses of the legislature, a Senator was chosen to represent this state in the Senate of the U.S. in place of general Smith whose term of service has for some time expired... The following was the state of the poll:"  Augusta Chronicle (Augusta, GA).  December 2, 1809.</note>
