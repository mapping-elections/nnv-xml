				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Joseph Green was supported by the Republicans, although he was a Federalist.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Mr. Editor... the democrats in this county detered by their insigficancy as a party, have long declined making head, in their political capacity, against the federal influence in this quarter. Catching however, this yer the impulse, which has been communicated to their whole party in the State, by the masterhand in Baltimore, they have been violent and zealous in their efforts to divide us."  Federal Republican (Georgetown, DC).  October 10, 1815.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Accordingly they arranged and systematised an opposition...; and to bring their efforts to bear, selected Col. Green one of the candidates for the Sheriffalty, as the object of their patronage- This gentleman is a federalist as well as his opponent, Thomas A. Davis."  Federal Republican (Georgetown, DC).  October 10, 1815.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The result has gloriously announced the stability and integrity of Federal principles in Charles county- this land of steady political habits. Davis has a majority of 194 over Col. Green. We regret that the latter should be compelled to share the mortification of this defeat with our political opponents.  A Voter."  Federal Republican (Georgetown, DC).  October 10, 1815.</note>
