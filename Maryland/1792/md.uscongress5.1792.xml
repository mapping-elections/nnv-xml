				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Charles Ridgely was a well know Federalist from Baltimore County and Samuel Smith became a leader in the Republican party.  However, some books listed these candidates in the opposite parties during the early 1790's. Parties were still forming and many opinions changed in the period shortly after the Constitution was adopted. Though Samuel Smith did not run for Congress in 1792 specifically as a Federalist, his election was looked upon as a victory for the Administration (at the time in the hands of the Federalist). Alexander Hamilton established a rapport with him and they exchanged correspondence. Smith also voted with the Administration on most major pieces of legislation. Sometime during 1794 Samuel Smith began to move slowly into the Republican cam There were two men with the name Charles Ridgely from Baltimore County who were involved in politics at the same time. Both were elected to the House of Delegates at the same time and appear to have been at least in this early time period, Anti-Federalists.</note>
