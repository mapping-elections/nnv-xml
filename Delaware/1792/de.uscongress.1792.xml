				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The results of this election were disputed by Henry Latimer and eventually reversed.  Delaware had election laws requiring voters to write down the names of two candidates, one of whom must not be a resident of the same county as the voter.  Some votes for Henry Latimer in Newcastle and Kent Counties were rejected on the grounds that they did not follow this rule.  Some votes for John Patton were accepted in Sussex County even though they did not follow this rule.  A committee of the U.S. House of Representatives decided that 68 votes for John Patton and 9 votes for Henry Latimer in Sussex County that were accepted should have been rejected, and that 4 votes for Henry Latimer in Kent County that were rejected should be accepted.  When these changes were made, Henry Latimer was declared the winner with 2238 votes to 2205 votes for John Patton.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The committee are therefore of the opinion, that John Patten is not entitled to a seat in this House.  They are also of the opinion that Henry Latimer is entitled to a seat in this House, as the representative of the State of Delaware."  Cases of Contested Elections in Congress 1789-1834.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Claypoole's American Daily Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA) of October 24, 1792 lists John Patton with a total of 2263 votes.</note>
