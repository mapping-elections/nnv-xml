                <note resp="Philip Lampi">John C. Brush was elected in October, but due to a Delaware law disqualifying a clergyman from office, was found, on January 8 "not duly qualified to be a member of their house."  He was expelled from the Delaware House of Representatives on a straight party line vote on January 14, with a new election ordered for January 21  "Brush got eight hundred less votes than in October, but he still defeated his Federalist opponent".
