					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"This choice, we learn, was the same as last year...Two Federal votes were rejected by the Selectmen; which, according to the decision of last year, ought to have been received; which would have elected Mr. F.  It will be recollected that Mr. Hobbs was declared to have been illegally elected last year, and lost his seat.  He, however, had voted in the organization of the government."   Columbian Centinel. Massachusetts Federalist (Boston, MA).  May 9, 1810.</note>
