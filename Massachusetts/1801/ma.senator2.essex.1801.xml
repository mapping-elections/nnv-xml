The Governor, Council and Legislature, attended by the General Staff, and other officers, and escorted by the Independent Cadets, proceeded to the Old Brick Meeting-house ... In the afternoon, the two Houses convened in the Representatives' Chamber, to fill the eleven vacancies in the Senate. The first to be filled was in Essex, wherein the candidates was, the Hon. ENOCH TITCOMB, and Capt. JACOB CROWINSHIELD. The whole number of votes were 252--of which Mr. TITCOMB had 149, and was chosen. This election decided the political composition of the Legislature:--Three fifths of which are decidedly Federal."  Columbian Centinel. Massachusetts Federalist (Boston, MA).  May 30, 1801.</note>
