				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"It has several times been suggested that all was not right in the late York Election. That these suggestions were well founded, appears from the following communications to the Editor, and the authority of Gentlemen of the first respectability. What may be offered in extenuation of such conduct is yet to be learnt. The subject, however, is too important to be overlooked, and demands serious inquiry. If it be the will of a majority of all the free electors of York District, that Mr. Cutts shall be their representative, no one will complain; -- but if his election has been obtained by jacobin fraud and finesse, it is the duty of those electors who have been deprived of the exercise of their right of suffrage, most spiritedly to remonstrate against a measure so dangerous to the community. 'MR. JENKS, Be so good as to hint through the medium of your useful paper, that although Mr. Cutts, of Pepperellborough, as is said, is to go to Congress to supply the place of Mr. Thatcher yet he is not chosen by the people, because there are six or seven towns in the county which have not received precepts for calling meetings; and by that means have actually been deprived of voting.--Now if General Goodwin, who is paid for distributing these precepts, has received another compensation from a rich family, to keep them from us, because we are Federal, and should have voted for a Federal Representative, we think we are ill treated. A COUNTRYMAN.' 'MR. JENKS, I saw a note in your paper not long since, intimating that Mr. Cutts, was actually chosen. Such as have no objections against the man, with for the privilege which the constitution grants them, of giving in their votes for whom they will.--In this instance, this has not been the case.--There are several respectable towns in this county, whcich were not notified to meet on the day appointed for this purpose; from which the precepts were kept back. We do not say that this is a Jacobin trick, yet we think it looks much like it. If the High Sheriff is paid for sending these to every town and plantation, we hope that he is not more than paid for retaining them. If these precepts have been lost or mislaid by the neglect of others to whom they were committed to distribute, then we think that the Sheriff ought to be apprised of it;--but if through this neglect, then we think that the public ought to know it. If a representative is to be chosen by the voice of the people, and if one third of the people have had no voice in it, then it appears that he is not chosen according to the constitution. It would give much satisfaction to many inquiring minds to be informed how this mistake happened. AN INQUIRER.'"  Jenks' Portland Gazette (Portland, ME).  August 3, 1801.</note>
