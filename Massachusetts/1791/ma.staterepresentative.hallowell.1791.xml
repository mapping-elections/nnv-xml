				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"May 2, 1791. The first action taken at this meeting was upon a motion to send a representative to the General Court, which was carried forty-one (41) being in favor and thirty-eight (38) against. A reconsideration however, of the vote was moved which prevailed, and the house was again polled upon the question of sending a representative, when there appeared twenty (20) for and forty (40) against it. The meeting was then dissolved and a meeting organized for the transaction of town business."  The History of Augusta, 231-232.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"May 13, 1791. This meeting was called at the request of twenty-six (26) freeholders who were dissatisfied with the results of the former meeting, and were upset that the vote to elect a representative had been overturned. Upon assembling, the meeting decided to elect a representative by a vote of fifty-two (52) to forty-six (46). The following are the results."  The History of Augusta, 231-232.</note>
