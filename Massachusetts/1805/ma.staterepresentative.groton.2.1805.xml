				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"A letter from the Northern part of the county of Middlesex, dated May 8th, 1805 says 'The citizens of Groton have again evinced their "steady habits and old fashioned principles," by electing the Hon. T. Bigelow and Maj. Joseph Moors to represent them in the General Court the present year. Federalism in that town has never before enjoyed so complete a victory.' The Democrats, I am told were so dismayed, when they knew the result of the first trial, that they made no opposition to Moors."  Columbian Centinel. Massachusetts Federalist (Boston, MA).  May 11, 1805.</note>
