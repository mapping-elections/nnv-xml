                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"The House of Representatives, elected the Hon. HARRISON G. OTIS, Esq. Speaker ... [The votes for Speaker were 200--of which Mr. OTIS had 124, Gen. KNOX 2, Mr. LOWELL 1, and PEREZ MORTON, Esq. 73.--The federal majority, 54: but if we add three federal members, who were not qualified in season to vote, that majority may be estimated at 57, at least, in the House.]"  Columbian Centinel. Massachusetts Federalist (Boston, MA).  May 28, 1803.</note>
                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"In the House of Representatives the number of votes for Speaker, was 200--necessary to make a choice 101 ... Mr. OTIS was declared to be elected ... It appears by the above that the Republican candidate for Speaker in the House of Representatives, obtained 73 votes. This proves to a demonstration that Republicanism has gained ground in the late election. Last year the whole number of Republicans that were in the H. of Representatives, did not exceed 72, and when the vote was taken for Speaker on Wednesday last, there was (at a low calculation) as many as 25 Republicans absent.--So much for the triumph of Federalism in Massachusetts! a few more such triumphs and our wishes will be gratified. [Gazeteer.]"  Columbian Minerva (Dedham, MA).  May 31, 1803.</note>
                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"Extract of a letter from our Correspondent at Boston, dated 26th April [sic], 1803. 'Yesterday was a proud day for Massachusetts. For five years we have not seen so paramount a display of genuine federalism. Our new legislature convened. The democrats had for a few days fondly hoped for a majority in the House; and their whole force was on the ground, officered and equipped. They had fixed on Mr. Morton for speaker ... A ballot was then had for speaker--two federal candidates had been spoken of, Mr. Otis and General Knox; but the latter very honorably relinquished in favor of the former. The votes were, for Mr. Otis 124; for Mr. Morton, 73. There were two votes for General Knox, and one for Mr. Sewell, (put in by Mr. Otis) and three federal members not having qualified for voting, did not vote. Mr. Otis, you will recollect, has lately been removed by Mr. Jefferson from the office of District Attorney. The federal strength of the House then may safely be put at 130--the democratic 73. There are between 30 and 40 more federalists elected, who have not yet taken their seats; and between 5 and 10 democrats. All the exercises of the day were highly federal."  New-York Evening Post (New York, NY).  May 30, 1803.</note>
