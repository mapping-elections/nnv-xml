				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The Salem Gazette (Salem, MA) refers to the Republican ticket as the Virginia ticket.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"In our last, we stated, that Capt. Crowninshield was chosen Representative for Essex South District. The following is the state of the votes ... Virginia Majority, 562. Crowninshield is thus not only re-elected, but that by a vastly increased majority; and, though he is engaged in the support of an administration, whose system is utterly to destroy the political weight of this part of the union in the national councils, yet he will have the pleasure to reflect, that in this work of degradation he has the approbation of those whom it is to ruin."  Salem Gazette (Salem, MA).  November 9, 1804.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"THE ELECTION of Presidential Electors and Members of Congress, was on Monday last in this State. The following is the result in Essex South District for Member of Congress, and the votes for the Electoral ticket do not essentially vary from it ... Republican Majority 560. Increase of Republican votes in Essex South District since the Congressional election in 1802, four hundred and eighty four, and the federal votes have increased 34! ... The above result is the best commentary we can offer in answer to certain publications in the Gazette and other federal papers. We hope our republican brethren will enjoy their just triumph with dignity, and leave their political opponents to repent at their leisure. We certainly wish them no harm. The election in this Town was conducted with a degree of harmony that was honorable to the Selectmen and to the Electors. They were kept in good humour by several handbills which were issued, 'undoubtedly for that purpose,' and with no intention of influencing voters, as the result has fully demonstrated. The 'active partizans' on the opposition side had a sad time of it, however.--Their expedition to Danvers on Sunday night eventually turned out 'a poor voyage.' The address to the 'Federalists of Danvers,' was too light to preserve its equilibrium, and fell to the ground--and the poor benighted travellers were not enlightened enough to recover their lost treasure. We were lucky enough, however, to peruse one of these federal productions, and cannot forbear making an extract:--'FEDERALISTS OF DANVERS,--Remember, that if you choose Mr. READ, he goes to Congress, not for his good but yours, greatly against his own incliniation and interest, and only in compliance with the urgent wishes of many Federalists. Unite to a man this day in his support--he deserves it of you; AND IT DEPENDS UPON THE TOWN OF DANVERS, whether Essex South District shall be represented by a man of Virginia politics, or of New-England politics. We might as well choose a representative from the state of Virginia, as Crowninshield. Be true to yourselves, and give the number of votes you did in April 1803, which was 230! You will have the co-operation of a DERBY, a PRESCOTT, a PICKMAN, and all the characters you most respect in the District.' Here we might retort--but we forbear. The greatest Merchant in the United States is put in the back ground to make room for 'a Derby, a Prescott, a Pickman'!!! We always thought Mr. GRAY was not one of the junto at heart, and that as a merchant he must unavoidably prefer Mr. CROWNINSHIELD to Mr. READ as a Member of Congress--and in transacting private business none but a fool would hesitate to whom the preference should be given."  Salem Register (Salem, MA).  November 8, 1804.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"TO THE EDITOR: 'Salem, Nov. 6--SIR--We have re-elected Crowninshield, for Congress, by a majority of 550 votes at least. He had about 107 at the last election. All the returns are in but Manchester, (which is federal, though small) and Mr. C. has now 638 majority. The Republican Electoral List has nearly the same majority.' What are we to expect from the branches, when the 'Junto' is perishing in the trunk?"  Eastern Argus (Portland, ME).  November 8, 1804.</note>
