                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Stockbridge, to his friend in this town, dated Tuesday, May 15th. 'Yesterday we had our annual meeting for the choice of a Representative. The federalists, with Judge Sedgwick at their head, exerted their utmost efforts. On the day of the election they sent an express to Richmond, with a horse and chair, and brought in a young man, who had removed to that town, and gone into business there, upon a contract for six months, as a Journeyman. He was offered and admitted as a voter. One of the Tutors of Williams' College also attended and claimed a right to vote, notwithstanding his residence for several years at Williamstown in the capacity of a Tutor. Their exertions, in other respects, were in proportion. The republicans generally turned out with spirit and unanimity. The result was that A. WILLIAMS, the republican candidate, had 106 votes--E. Cook, the federal candidate, had 87--and there were two scattering votes, given by the two candidates. On this event, as a demonstration of the progress of political sentiments in this town, you will accept our congratulations.'"  The Pittsfield Sun (Pittsfield, MA).  May 21, 1804.</note>
