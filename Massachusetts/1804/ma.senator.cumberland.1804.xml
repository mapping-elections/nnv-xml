From Portland.--'The democrats, with Wedgery at their head, held a secret caucus here, to cram down the democratic list.--This getting wind, a meeting of the federalists was called; which was full and spirited.--Mr. Parker addressed the citizens in a judicious and animating speech; and the result was the largest federal vote ever given in this federal town.--You may count upon the reelection of our old Senators.'"

                        <note resp="Philip Lampi">"In this town, on Monday last, is a convincing proof of the progress of Republicanism. On Friday evening a meeting of the Republicans was called, to determine who they would support for State Officers, and to come to some understanding, as no regular opposition had heretofore been made to the overbearing Federal influence. Knowing the great superiority of Federal numbers, they were not invited, and as the evening was very stormy, but about fifty Republicans assembled--they however unanimously agreed to support the Republican Ticket, and adjourned. The next morning, the Federalists appeared greatly alarmed; they circulated into every recess of the town, Handbills, declaring a 'secret Caucus' had been held the evening before, and enjoining 'all Federal Republicans, of every trade and profession' to meet the next evening, and support the present Officers; in their paper of the same day, every means was used to inflame the passions of the citizens, and to misrepresent the proceedings of the Republicans, urging every Federalist to attend their Caucus, and follow their dictates. They met to the number of 300, their best speakers did their best, all classes were flattered, and those whom 'tis desired should not 'rule the town' were strongy urged to assist them. They appointed a Distributing Committee more than twice as large as that of the Repulicans, who beat another Committee to range every street and alley, and urge votes upon all who would accept them. Their other paper, of Monday morning, was also put in requisition, a pompous and flattering account of their Caucus appeared, while that of the Republicans was represented as 'destroying the peace and harmony of the town.['] Such uncommon efforts, as might be supposed produced the largest meeting ever known in this town--and behold the result--the Republicans have near 106 votes more than they ever had before!"
