                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"By the foregoing result we are confirmed in our opinion, that the election was in the [illegible] of the Federalists. By comparing the number of federal votes above with the number in the last April meeting, we find there were nearly 200 Federalists who did not attend the meeting, and who of course might have [tipped?] the federal scale. On the other hand, the antifederalists came out with nearly all their numbers: their highest vote the last [illegible] was at the election of Representatives, [illegible] their present vote comes to within 42 of [illegible] Thus we see it was in the power of the Federalists to have outnumbered the other party, as far as they have (owing to the difference of exertion) outnumbered the Federalists."

                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"On Monday last was the annual Town Meeting for the choice of Town Officers. Mr. WILLIAM GRAY was Moderator, and after prayers, the Town proceeded to the business of the Meeting. The Republicans succeeded in every measure, with a handsome majority."
