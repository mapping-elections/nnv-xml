                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT, 'Plymouth, May 8, 7 o'clock, P.M. We have just finished a contested Election for a Representative, which has continued 9 hours. The Friends of him who mis-represented the town last year, (who are made up of democrats and six months federalists) made every exertion in their power for their candidate. After repeated trials, I am happy to inform you the final result. Gen. GOODWIN, a truly federal republican, had 145 votes, and was accordingly chosen. John D. Dunbar, Esq. the old representative and an apostate federalist, had 131 votes. Gen. G. would have been elected at the first trial, had not the hardy and industrious Fisherman, who are almost unanimously federal, been absent, as they frequently are at this season of the year."  Boston Gazette (Boston, MA).  May 10, 1804.</note>
