				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"In Danvers a spirit of Federalism, honorable to the town, was displayed. The Federal votes were at first nearly equally divided between Gen. Foster and Capt. Page; but no choice being effected, Capt. Page, in a very honorable manner, declared himself not a candidate at the second trial, and requested that the Federal votes might be united for General Foster. The result was, that General Foster had 238 votes, and poor Hutchinson, 28!"  Salem Gazette (Salem, MA).  May 7, 1799.</note>
