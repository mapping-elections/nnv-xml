				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"A Boston paper of the 13th inst. states that the return of the votes for Senators for this County to the Secretary's Office, was not made in  season - and that consequently this County will not be represented in the Senate the ensuing year. - Col. Danforth, the Postmaster at Pittsfield, has given in an oath that the votes were deposited in the Post office by the High Sheriff and forwarded on in season to have arrived at the Secretary's Office previous to the day appointed for counting and sorting the votes. This being the fact, it is presumed that some method (by liberal construction,) will be devised whereby the gentlemen who have been chosen Senators for this county will be admitted to their seats."  Andrews's Western Star (Stockbridge, MA).  May 26, 1795.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Friday May 29. Since Wednesday, the Legislature has been engaged in deliberations on the deficiency of a representation of the Commonwealth, in Senate. The public has been already informed, that the votes for Senators for the county of Berkshire, were not received in season, at the Secretary's Office. In consequence of this, it was determined in Senate, that Senators from that district could not be admitted. After this, a message was sent from the Senate to the House, assigning a time for coming to the choice of Councillors. The house took the message into consideration; and it appearing to them, that as the Constitution provided, that the Senate should consist of Forty members, from who the Councillors, in the first instance, were to be chosen; and as by the decision of the Senate that body did not consist of but 38, they non-concurred the assignment. The business rests here. It is involved in difficulties, which appear, to formidable to be easily removed. - Should the Senate and House adhere to their votes, no choice of Councillors can take place, nor can the Governor and Lieutenant Governor be qualified. The question has been discussed with great candor; and we hope some means will speedily be found out to remedy the inconvenience."  Columbian Centinel (Boston, MA).  May 30, 1795.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"MASSACHUSETTS, Boston, June 3. LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS. On Saturday, the two houses concurred, in an assignment, for coming to the choice of two Senators for the county of Berkshire. The two houses met in Convention for the purpose, when the hon. Thompson J. Skinner and John Bacon, Esquires, were elected."  Andrews's Western Star (Stockbridge, MA).  June 16, 1795.</note>
