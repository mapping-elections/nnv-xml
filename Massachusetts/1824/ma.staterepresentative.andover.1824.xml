				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Andover, May 7th, 1824 - We yesterday held our Representative meeting, and so complete a Republican triumph was never before witnessed in this town. A motion was made by a Federalist, not to chose a Representative, and negated by an overwhelming majority. A motion was then made by a Republican to choose two, (being half the number the town constitutionally entitled to) and carried by a like majority. The poll was then opened, and out of two hundred and thirty votes cast, our ticket had two hundred eighteen."  Independent Chronicle and Boston Patriot (Boston, MA).  May 8, 1824.</note>
