				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"At a meeting for the choice of one or more representatives, the selectmen stated that the town was entitled to four, and called on the voters to bring in votes for from one to four.  A motion was made and seconded to send two and no more, and this the selectmen, as they had previously determined to do, refused to put or to permit debate upon.  Great excitement followed this decision, in the mist of which a motion to adjourn was made and seconded, but the selectmen refused to put it, one of them giving as a reason for such refusal, that there were votes in the ballot boxes.  Many voters left the meeting, and other refused to vote.  Four persons were declared elected.  It was held that the election was not free, and therefore void."  Boston Patriot (Boston, MA).  July 24, 1813.  The report by the committee on elections which declared the seats of those elected void was accepted by the House on a vote of 169 to 73 and those seats declared vacated.</note>
