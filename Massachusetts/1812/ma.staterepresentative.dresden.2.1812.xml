				<note resp="Philip Lampi">In the first election, held on May 7, 1812, John Johnson (Republican), the incumbent, was defeated. After this vote several individuals being dissatisfied with the result called for another election to select a second state representative. This election was held on May 16th.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">This election was contested as it was uncertain whether Dresden was entitled to have two representatives and also the notification time for a Town Meeting was less than required. The Committee on elections declared that the second vote for Representative was void and the winning candidate was not entitled to a seat in the General Court.</note>
