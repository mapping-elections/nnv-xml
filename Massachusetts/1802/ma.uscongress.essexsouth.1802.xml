				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"ANOTHER TRIUMPH! As another offset against the 'weight and talents' of the Federal candidates in Worcester County, we announce, from credible authority, the election of the Hon. JACOB CROWNINSHIELD, of Salem, against the 'friend of WASHINGTON and ADAMS,' the ex-Secretary PICKERING."  The National Aegis (Worcester, MA).  November 3, 1802.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"In this district the Hon. TIMOTHY PICKERING, Esq. was the federal candidate, and the Hon. JACOB CROWNINSHIELD the jacobin one. The election law, as 'managed' in this town, was a perfect nullity. There were 92 more votes given than on any former occasion, and the majority for Crowninshield, which was announced in open town-meeting by a democratic shout resembling an Indian yell. The following is a correct statement of the votes of the district, which, it is no pleasure to us to say, certifies the election of Crowninshield."  Salem Gazette (Salem, MA).  November 2, 1802.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"On Monday last were the votes taken for a member of Congress in this District. In Salem the greatest number of votes were given ever known. The result was in favor of Hon. JACOB CROWNINSHIELD, Esq. The Selectmen did themselves great honor through the day, and will deserve a grateful remembrance from their fellow citizens. After the choice had been declared, there was a burst of joy, which began from the imprudence of a man who supposed a different choice had been made. Many were involuntarily led to join, but the general conviction of its folly, we trust, will in future prevent the repetition of such conduct. We congratulate our fellow citizens upon the event of the Election."  The Salem Register (Salem, MA).  November 4, 1802.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The vote of Monday was highly honourable to Mr. PICKERING, though it did not secure his election. He had the support of the property, respectability, and ancient inhabitants, of this district. In this town that gentleman had more votes than have ever before been given to any candidate; but the exhibition of 'new' and unknown citizens, on the opening of the hall, was ominous of the issue ... innumerable 'Citizens' of unknown faces, to whom Crowninshield owes his election, deposited their votes without examination, some of whom it is know, with all the pains that had been previously taken, had not their names on the list ... we learn that there was the same resistance to the law in Marblehead (which an ingenious correspondent calls the Crater of Jacobinism) as in this town."  Salem Gazette (Salem, MA).  November 5, 1802.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Essex (South District)--Hon. JACOB CROWNINSHIELD (Republican) against the File leader of the Essex JUNTO, by a majority of 105."  The National Aegis (Worcester, MA).  November 10, 1802.</note>
