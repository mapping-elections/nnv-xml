				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The elections in the country have, in general, been very thinly attended - owing in some measure to the late fall of snow, making the passing bad."  The Massachusetts Centinel (Boston, MA).  December 20, 1788.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Massachusetts law required a majority to elect for the U.S. House of Representatives. The whole number of votes cast was 1316, therefore a candidate needed 659 votes in order to be elected.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"On 12 February Governor Hancock asked his Council for advice about Partridge and about George Leonard, judge of probate in Bristol County, who had been elected to Congress from the Bristol-Dukes-Nantucket District.  The Council replied in writing the same day that it was 'inexpedient' for a man to hold the office of judge of probate and a seat in Congress, but that it did not find anything in the state constitution which prevented a sheriff from also being a member of Congress.  The Council advised, however, that it would be inexpedient to introduce the practice of sheriffs being absent for long periods although Partridge 'may at present be indulged' and take a seat in Congress 'consistently with the safety of that county' (Council Proceedings, Thursday 12 February, M-Ar).  The next day Governor Hancock sent the Council's written reply to the legislature and asked for its advice (13 February, Miscellaneous Legislative Documents, House Files, M-Ar).  The two houses appointed a joint committee which wrote a report that was approved and sent to the Governor on Monday, 16 February.  The legislature declared that if George Leonard continued to hold the office of judge of probate and also took a seat on Congress, any future legislature would address the Governor authorizing him and the Council to appoint another person judge of probate in Bristol County.  But the legislature refused to give advice about George Partridge.  It pointed out that sheriffs served during the pleasure of the governor, and (with the advice of his Council) were removable by him at any time.  Sheriffs were not removable in any other way except through impeachment by the House and a trial before and conviction by the Senate.  Therefore the House and Senate declared that intervention by the legislature was 'neither necessary or proper; and from the conduct and advice of your Council, they see no reason to doubt the wisdom of that constitutional provision' (House and Senate Proceedings, 13, 14, 16 February)."  The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections: 1788-1790, Vol. I.  p 575-76.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Our friend D Cobb might have been chosen for the district in which he lives by a large majority, but declined and they turned their attention to a Mr. Leonard the Feds, and the Antis to Mr. Bisho But the district will be divided between the three above mentioned and no one will be chosen in the first instance.  I have paid a visit to Taunton.  David desires to be particular remembered to you.  In the second trial if he should be elected he will not hesitate in going."  Henry Jackson to Henry Knox, Boston 21 December.  RC, Knox Papers, MHi.  As reprinted in The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections: 1788-1790, Vol. I.  p 585.</note>
