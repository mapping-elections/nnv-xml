The returns of votes from 22 towns in the county of York, leave the following result: Bartlett 540, Rice 550, Woodman 1639, Storer 1171, Leland 774, Fernald 706. It is more than probable the Hon. John Woodman is re-elected .... From the present returns it will be seen that Mr. Leland, the present Senator, and Mr Storer, will be the highest candidates. If the Legislature in joint meeting is federal, Mr. Leland will be again the Senator; if republican his place will be supplied by Joseph Storer, Esq."  Freeman's Friend (Saco, ME).  April 23, 1806.</note>
