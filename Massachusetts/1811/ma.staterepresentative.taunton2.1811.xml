				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Federalists, at a previous meeting had agreed to support four candidates.  To try only one the first time, and if successful, to try for the other three.  On Monday, at our first trial, the Federal candidate had 319 votes, the democratic 256 - leaving a Federal majority of 63.  And on the second trial, which was for the other candidates, (notwithstanding the audacious fraud, and glaring insult upon the town and the public, of an unprincipled and impertinent democrat, who actually put in two votes, and was detected in attempting with his guilty hand, to put in the third) the result was such as to make an average majority in favour of the four Federal candidates to be 52."
