				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The issue of Maine separating from Massachusetts was again revived and initially started with the State Elections in April. By May, when State Representatives were being elected, it became the central issue in Maine and resulted in a significant increase of Representatives chosen. Newspapers reported that 150 members were chosen from Maine, of which 90 were Republicans and 60 Federalists. On the question of Separation it was stated that 125 were for and 25 against. Within days of the Legislature convening, over a hundred petitions were presented from Maine towns in favor of separating from Massachusetts. A Committee was formed to write up a bill for separating from Massachusetts and establishing Maine as an independent state.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The first bill called for a vote by "the whole people of Massachusetts" on this question, which was defeated. After some debate, and the decision to allow only the people of Maine to vote on Separation, the bill passed.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">July 26, 1819 was set as the date for voting on the question of separation.</note>
