                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"In the fall election 1814, Chittenden, while slightly leading his opponent and brother-in-law Galusha, still failed of having a popular majority of the votes, but was elected by a safe majority by the General Assembly; but its attitude towards the war completed the downfall of the Federalist party in the state and the rest of New England, where it had made its last stand; and he retired from public life at the close of his second term."
