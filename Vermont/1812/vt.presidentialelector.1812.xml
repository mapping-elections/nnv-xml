                <note resp="Philip Lampi">The Vermont Mirror (Middlebury, VT), October 28, and The Freeman's Journal and Philadelphia Mercantile Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA): "Extract of a letter from a federal member of the Legislature, dated Montpelier, Oct. 23. 'Since the election of Chase, as Senator, we consider there is no hope in the choice of electors. Could it be certainly known, that, with the votes of Vermont, Clinton would be elected, I have no doubt that a large number would desert the democratic ranks. They evidently wish they could do it with safety.--This is evidently the case with many; and could the electors be postponed one fortnight, we should succeed; the democrats will bring it on as soon as the choice can be made, which will be on Thursday of next week.'"</note>
                <note resp="Philip Lampi">The Vermont Mirror (Middlebury, VT), November 4: "Vermont Electors. On Friday the 30th October the Council and House of Representatives met in joint committee and made choice of the following persons as electors of President and Vice President of the U. States. They are understood to be all Madisonians. About 12 or 14 of the Republicans united with the federalists in support of the Clintonian ticket. Nathaniel Niles, Noah Chittenden, William Slade, John H. Andrus, Elihu Luce, Johsih Wright, William A. Griswold, Mark Richards."</note>
                <note resp="Philip Lampi">North Star (Danville, VT): "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS. On Friday of last week both Houses of the Legislature met in joint committee and made choice of the following MADISONIAN Republicans as Presidential Electors for this State: Nathaniel Niles, Noah Chittenden, Wm. Slade, John H. Andrus, Elihu Luce, Josiah Wright, Wm. A. Griswold, Mark Richards. The average majority for the foregoing gentlemen, was about fifty. Here follows the Ticket supported by the FEDERALISTS:--Elias Keyes, John Cameron, Horatio Seymour, Alden Spooner, Beriah Loomis, John Mattocks, Bradford Kinne, Luther Bernard. All the gentlemen compirising the above ticket, are true MADISONIAN republicans but ONE, and he became a Quid because the people had too much discernment to bestow on him their suffrages as member of Congress, The drift of the federalists in this manoeuvre, has not concealed the cloven foot. Their object was to divide the republican interest, and profit by the division. The same ungenerous game was played by their supporting Judge TYLER as Senator in opposition to Mr. CHASE. It is ungenerous, because it generally exposes the republicans thus supported to unjust censure. The only effect it has on our feelings is commiseration for the worthy characters who are abused by federal favor at this important crisis. Like the Camelion, modern federalists can assume any colors they please, and make their principles bend to any circumstances. What a convenience it is to have such pliable consciences!!"</note>
                <note resp="Philip Lampi">The Boston Patriot (Boston, MA) and Columbian Phenix: or, Providence Patriot (Providence, RI): "On Friday last the Legislature of Vermont chose Eight Whig Republican Electors of President and Vice President of the United States by a majority of 43 votes. They are all true, and will give their votes for Madison and Gerry."</note>
