				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"On Saturday, an Election for 5 Commissioners took place in the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties. It has long been the opinion of many of the most intelligent Citizens of the Northern Liberties, that the interest of the District would be promoted by the Election of Commissioners, without regard to Party politics. A meeting, apparently with that view, was called, a short time ago, in some of the public Newspapers. Although many Citizens did not see the propriety of confining, what professed to be a general call of the Citizens, to the Papers of one Party, and although some Republicans, on that account, did not attend the Meeting, there were, nevertheless, nearly an equal proportion of the different Parties present. . . . Although neither of the Tickets was formed avowedly on Party principles, or composed exclusively of Men of one party; yet the contest was conducted pretty much as Elections commonly have been, of late, in that District; Federalist and Oldschoolmen, as they call themselves, on one side, and Democrats on the other. To the last, the result must be peculiarly gratifying."  The Intelligencer, and Weekly Advertiser (Lancaster, PA).  May 9, 1818.</note>
