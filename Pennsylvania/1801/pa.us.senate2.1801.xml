				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"On the second vote ... Mr. Muhlenberg was declared duly elected."  The Philadelphia Gazette and Daily Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA).  February 20, 1801.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">John Bleakly, Congressman from Philadelphia City, changed his vote from William Jones on the first ballot to Peter Muhlenberg on the second ballot.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Republican outcry, however, was not concerned with the question of the candidates.  It was rather the alarming fact that fifteen Republicans had sided with 31 Federalists to defeat Logan, who had 45 Republican votes.  What had happened to the tradition of unanimity and majority rule?  While it was true the Federalists had not elected a candidate of their own, they had triumphed in the defeat of a man whom they hated only less than Jefferson.  The friends of General Muhlenberg had done him and the Republican cause a great disservice.  So went the refrain in the Aurora, accompanied by more of less open threats of reprisals against those who had thus sinned."  Higginbotham, Sanford W.  The Keystone in the Democratic Arch: Pennsylvania Politics, 1800-1816.  Philadelphia: Pennyslvania Historical and Museum Commission, 1952. 33.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Governor McKean was an interested spectator of these events.  According to Findlay, he had been active in the support of Logan, and he had certainly entertained hopes that Muhlenberg would not accept the office.  When Muhlenberg did so, McKean proposed that Jefferson give Muhlenberg the office of Supervisor of Revenue so that Logan might be appointed to the senatorial vacancy.  Although the suggestion was made ostensibly for the purpose of restoring harmony, McKean had probably given some consideration to the desirability of removing Muhlenberg as a possible rival for the governorshi In any case, the proposal was acted on; and Logan was commissioned in July to act as United States Senator pending the meeting of the legislature."  Higginbotham, Sanford W.  The Keystone in the Democratic Arch: Pennsylvania Politics, 1800-1816.  Philadelphia: Pennyslvania Historical and Museum Commission, 1952. 34.</note>
