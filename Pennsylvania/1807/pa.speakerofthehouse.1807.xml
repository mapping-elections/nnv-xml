				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Extract of a letter from Lancaster, dated December 1, 1807: 'The death of Mr. Carver, left the whole number of members at 85. It was ascertained before the election began, that 84 of those were in the borough: Paul Apple of Bucks, was the absent member. It was known that the Federalists and quids, had after much discussion, settled down upon Charles Porter, of Fayette, as their candidate. Simon Snyder was of course the candidate of the democratic party, and he had the vote of every man who was elected by that party.'" The True American and Commercial Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA).  December 4, 1807.</note>
