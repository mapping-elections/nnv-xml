				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"McKean felt confident of Gregg's selection by a margin of one vote.  The only apparent way for the Democrats to defeat him was to find a candidate who would be able to gain a few Quid votes and to hold those that had been given to Steele.  It was this situation which explained the nomination of Boileau by the Democrats in January . . . Gregg was elected on the first ballot with 55 votes, while Boileau and Steele received forty and fourteen votes respectively.  Boileau, Leib, and most of the Philadelphia County delegation were among those voting for Steele.  There were two absentees at the senatorial election - John Orr, a Democratic Representative from Cumberland County was was ill; and John Thompson of Philadelphia County who had voted in the election for State Treasurer.  Had Thompson attended and voted for anyone other than Gregg, the latter would have failed of election sicne he would not have had a majority.  THere might then have been a chance for a Democratic victory when Orr returned.  An investigation of the circumstances showed that Thompson, a devoted follower of Leibe, had come to the Treasurer's election with his head tied in a handkerchief and had complained of a toothache or gumboil.  He had voted and then gone to the House chamber where he sat for a few moments and left.  Whether he talked with Leib in the meantime was a disputed point.  His absence was noted and a messenger sent after him.  Thompson agreed to come; but a member who then went in search of him found him at his lodging roasting figs before the fire.  The two started back to the House; but the election was over before they reached there."  Higginbotham, Sanford W.  The Keystone in the Democratic Arch: Pennsylvania Politics, 1800-1816.
