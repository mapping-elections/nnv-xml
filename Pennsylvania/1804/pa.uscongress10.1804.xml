				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The intrigues which were set of foot in Washington county in the Western part of this state, have terminated against the quids~ We understand that Mr. John Israel (son of Mr. Israel Israel of this district) was put forward there by the quids in opposition to Mr. Hoge, but the thing would not work, and Mr. Hamilton, a republican, was taken up for Congress at Mr. Hoge's desire." Aurora. General Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA).  October 13, 1804.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"As had been unfortunately witnessed in this district, several, who had been republicans, forsook their principlies and joined the federalist against the republican candidates: but happily the federalists and quids of Washington county have been completely defeated...Mr. John Israel of Pittsburg, has been one of the principle promoters of third partyism." Aurora. General Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA).  October 22, 1804.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"John Hamilton, esq. has been elected member of congress: this gentleman is a tried republican. He succeeds Mr. Hoge, a member of the present congress, who had been returned by the republican party but who opposed the admendment to the consitution." Aurora. General Advertiser (Philadelphia, PA).  October 22, 1804.</note>
