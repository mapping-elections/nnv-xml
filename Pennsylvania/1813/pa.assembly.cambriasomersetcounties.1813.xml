				<note resp="Philip Lampi">Somerset was one of those counties in Pennsylvania where the Republicans were so dominant that they became prone to state and regional infighting. This division within the Somerset Republican party often resulted in a host of candidates being offered in the Assembly elections. The Pennsylvania Republican (Harrisburg, PA)s went through a series of schisms and one of the players in this split was Michael Leib. Thus the description of "a kind of a Leib ticket to divide the Republicans" in the Original Returns. In 1811 Daniel Stoy was an unsuccessful candidate for the Assembly. He ran again in 1812, this time being elected and was re-elected in 1813. Although definitely elected as a Republican in 1812, he was apparently not endorsed for re-election by the party leaders (see the Republican Ticket published in The Intelligencer, and Weekly Advertiser (Lancaster, PA) from October 2, 1813.) In 1813, however, it appears that enough Republicans and many Federalists voted for him anyway, and he was re-elected. The author of the Original Returns breaks down the vote for Daniel Stoy, showing that he received much of his support from the Federalists (229 votes) and the remainder (368 votes) from Republicans. Both of the Leib candidates would be candidates again in 1814 but neither were elected and Daniel Stoy also ran unsuccessfully in 1815.</note>
