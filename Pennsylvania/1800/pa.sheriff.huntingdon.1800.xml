				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"At Huntingdon, John Patton, Esq. who before had been twice Sheriff of the county--a firm federalist and an honest man, has again been elected by a great majority, and the person on the return, a Mr. Williams, also a federalist, declared he would not accept the office, and offered to be security for Mr. Patton; yet the worthy conciliating Governor of Pennsylvania, refused to commission Mr. Patton, unless he would bring a certificate from a certain person, in another county, near 70 miles off, that he was a fit man; thus insulting not only Mr. Patton, but all the electors in the county of Huntingdon. [Let no modern Republican, or even democrat, say that this is abusing his excellency. It is a true statement, and whenever the Governor asks for proof, they shall be given.] -Phil. Gaz."  The Newark Gazette (Newark, NJ).  December 16, 1800.</note>
