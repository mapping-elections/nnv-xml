				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The Original Election Returns report 754 votes for James MacClure and 768 votes for John Snyder.  These results were officially contested and changed.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"In stating the totals, the votes of Liberty and Hemlock townships are omited ... as the Return judges thought proper not to receive them. However, there is an appeal to the Legislature, as respects the Assemblyman, and no doubt can exist, that eventually James MacClure will get his seat, even if Mr. Snyder can so far forget what he owes himself, as to contend against the fair choice of the People."  The Intelligencer, and Weekly Advertiser (Lancaster, PA).  October 28, 1820.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Mr. Harrington presented a petition from twenty qualified electors of the county of Columbia, accompanied with documents stating that the return judge of the late election omitted to include the votes given in Liberty and Hemlock districts in said county, thereby excluding James MacClure who had nine hundred and seventy five votes from a seat in the House of Representatives, and returned John Snyder, who had only eight hundred and twenty two votes." Journal of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, 1820.  11.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">James MacClure was awarded the contested election on January 4, 1821 and took his seat on January 9th.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">The Intelligencer, and Weekly Advertiser (Lancaster, PA) reports 745 votes for James MacClure.</note>
