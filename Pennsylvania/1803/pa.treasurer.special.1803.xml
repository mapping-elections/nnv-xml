				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Jacob Carpenter, the State Treasurer died in February, 1803; and a joint session of the two houses was held to choose his succesor.  Nathaniel B. Boileau, who had unsuccessfully opposed Frederick Conrad for Congress, had some faint hopes of election; but the real choice lay between the ambitious Speaker of the House, Isaac Weaver, Jr., and Jacob Martin of Lancaster, who offered to perform the duties and turn over the salary to Carpenter's widow and child.  Weaver was elected by a vote of 59-44, but he was sharply criticized by the Republican Lancaster Intelligencer for his cupidity and oppression of the helpless."  Higginbotham, Sanford W.  The Keystone in the Democratic Arch: Pennsylvania Politics, 1800-1816.  Philadelphia: Pennyslvania Historical and Museum Commission, 1952. 50.</note>
