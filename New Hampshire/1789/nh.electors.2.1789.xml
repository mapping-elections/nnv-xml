				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"January 7, the House proposed to choose the Electors in separate branches.  Non-concurred by the Senate.  After several motions were made and lost by each House, one among the number was of the House: 'Voted, That the names of ten persons who have the highest number of votes as Electors for a President of the United States be put into a box, and that the secretary and clerk of the House, under the inspection of two members of each branch, draw out the names of five persons, who shall be considered as electors of this State.'  Non-concurred by the Senate.  Finally, after a conference was held by a joint committee, the Senate made the following elections for Electors, and asked the concurrence of the House, which was given by a majority of 21 votes: Hon. Benjamin Bellows, John Pickering, Esq., Ebenezer Thompson, Esq., John Sullivan, Esq., John Parker, Esq."  Lyon, G. Parker.
