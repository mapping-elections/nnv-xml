				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"Nomination of Governor - Governor Bell, of New Hampshire, having been elected to the Senate of the United States for six years from the 4th March next, a caucus has been held at Concord for nomination of a candidate to succeed him in the gubernatorial chair."  American Statesman and Evening Advertiser (Boston, MA).  June 27, 1822.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"We learn from Concord, that on Friday evening, the 21st ult. the Grand State Legislative Caucus for nominating future State officers, was held at that place, by the members of the General Court, (who were sent thither by the people to legislate for them, good and wholesome laws for their protection; not to dictate to them who shall be their governors) - That this grand Inquisition was organized by appointing Hon. Richard H. Ayer, chairman, and Hon. Isaac Hill, Secretary - That they then cast lots who should be Chief among them, and ruler over the people.  But at the first ballot were so divided as not to agree among themselves who should be the highest - and after a second trial, the Hon. SAMUEL DINSMORE of Keene, had majority of their votes for our next Governor - and declared to be the man whom the people must 'delight to honor.'"  Farmer's Cabinet (Amherst, NH).  June 29, 1822.</note>
