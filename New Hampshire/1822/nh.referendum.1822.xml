				<note resp="Philip Lampi">This was an election to establish a new county.  This county would be formed in 1823 as Merrimack County.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"On motion of Mr. Hill, voted that a committee of two members to be joined by the House of Representatives, be raised to take into consideration the returns of the votes for and against the question whether a new county shall be erected, embracing the following towns, viz. Allenstown, Bow, Canterbury, Concord, Chichester, Epsom, Northfield, Pembroke, Loudon and Pittsfield, in the county of Rockingham; and Andover, Boscawen, Bradford, Dunbarton, Fishersfield, Henniker, Hopkinton, New-London, Salisbury, Sutton, Warner and Wilmot in the county of Hillsborough."  New-Hampshire Patriot and State Gazette (Concord, NH).  June 17, 1822.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The towns of Bradford, Pittsfield and Wilmot remain to be heard from - in each of which, it is reported, there was a small majority against the measure.  But there will be throughout the whole, nearly TWO to one, in favor of erecting a New County, from the contiguous towns in Rockingham and Hillsborough.  Private and local feelings may have had an operation in producing even the small number arrayed against the interests of the whole; while, in a sober hour, uninfluenced by any feelings of jealousy that some one town may be benefitted above the rest, those who have given their nay, would probably regret it.  There seems to be no possible ground for rational argument against the establishment of a central county; and indeed the only pretence of argument offered by those opposed to the plan, is - 'We expect you will at one time or another succeed in obtaining a new count; but - we will defeat you as long as we can!'"  New-Hampshire Patriot and State Gazette (Concord, NH).  March 25, 1822.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"We learn by a gentleman from Concord, that the bill establishing a New COUNTY, which had passed the Senate, has been rejected in the House by a majority of 10. - Also, that the committee appointed by the House to consider the expediency of districting the State anew into counties, have reported against the measure."  Hillsboro' Telegraph (Amherst, NH).  June 29, 1822.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"By persons from Concord, we further learn that the bill from the Senate for creating a New County was taken up in the House of Representatives on Tuesday last, agreeably to appointment, and made the subject of discussion through the day.  It was finally disposed of by a motion for its indefinite postponement, which was carried by a majority of about 10.  On Wednesday, a motion was made to reconsider this vote, which, after a long debate, was rejected by a majority of 14.  So our 'vigilance' must be exercised another year."  Farmer's Cabinet (Amherst, NH).  June 29, 1822.</note>
