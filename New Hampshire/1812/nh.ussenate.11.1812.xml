					<note resp="Philip Lampi">Eighty-eight making a choice, Mr. Cutts was chosen. In the Senate, on motion to concur with the House, the votes for concurring, six and six on the negative. It was moved to concur with the House by striking out Charles Cutts, and inserting David L. Morrill. On this motion the Senate were divided, six in favor, and six against it. Col. Adams then moved to concur by striking out Charles Cutts and inserting John Goddard, and the Senate were again divided, six voting in favor and six against the motion.  On subsequent day, on motion to concur by striking out Charles Cutts, and inserting Josiah Bartlett, the motion prevailed, seven voting in favor and five against it. This vote of the Senate, concurring with an amendment, went down to the House.  The main question was then taken "will the House concur with the amendment of the Senate." About thirteen or seventeen only voted in favor, so the House did not concur.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"In spite of their nominal majorities in the legislature, the Republicans of New Hampshire in 1812 were fatally weakened by the defection of their Peace party members.  This not only led to their defeat in the presidential and congressional elections but made itself dramatically evident in their failure, during two full sessions, to elect a United States senator.  Responsibility for this debacle lay with Josiah Sanborn of Epsom, who had been elected to the senate as a Republican but who belonged in spirit to the Peace party (fn: Plumer to William Plumer, Jr.  December 5, 1812, Letters 4, Plumer Papers (Library of Congress)).  He voted against all Republicans nominated by his colleagues and insisted upon the election of John Goddard, who, since his electoral vote against Madison, had of course become anathema to the party stalwarts.  The legislature finally ajourned without electing a senator, thus permitting the Federalists to send Jeremiah Mason to the Senate in 1813."  The Ninth State.  278.</note>
