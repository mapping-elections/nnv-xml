					<note resp="Philip Lampi">As was expected the Senate refused to concur with the House in the choice of J.K. Smith. In the Senate, Gov. Plumer was nominated, but not chosen - 6 for and 6 against. Here this business rested.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">Mr. Fisk of Amherst, at a subsequent day, brought the 'RESERVE' and moved to concur with an amendment by striking out J.K. Smith and inserting name of 'his Excellency William Plumer' on which motion the senate were equally divided; those voting for 'his excellency' who voted for J.K. Smith. On the last day of the session, at the moment of adjournment, Mr. Fisk, giving up 'his excellency' moved that the Senate concur with the House in the choice of J.K. Smith. On which motion the Senate were again equally divided.  The friends of peace voted uniformly for the Hon. Dr. Goddard.</note>
					<note resp="Philip Lampi">"In spite of their nominal majorities in the legislature, the Republicans of New Hampshire in 1812 were fatally weakened by the defection of their Peace party members.  This not only led to their defeat in the presidential and congressional elections but made itself dramatically evident in their failure, during two full sessions, to elect a United States senator.  Responsibility for this debacle lay with Josiah Sanborn of Epsom, who had been elected to the senate as a Republican but who belonged in spirit to the Peace party (fn: Plumer to William Plumer, Jr.  December 5, 1812, Letters 4, Plumer Papers (Library of Congress)).  He voted against all Republicans nominated by his colleagues and insisted upon the election of John Goddard, who, since his electoral vote against Madison, had of course become anathema to the party stalwarts.  The legislature finally ajourned without electing a senator, thus permitting the Federalists to send Jeremiah Mason to the Senate in 1813."  The Ninth State.  278.</note>
