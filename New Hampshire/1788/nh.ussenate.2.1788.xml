				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The House November 12 made choice of Nathaniel Peabody for a Senator in the Congress of the United States, years 40, nays 36.  The Senate on the same day refused concurrence in the choice of Nathaniel Peabody, yeas 2, nays 8."  New Hampshire Provincial and State Papers.  Vol. XXI.  Concord, NH: State of New Hampshire, 1867.  256.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"When the clerk was about to call the roll, my father rose and addressed the House, with great force and plainness, on the relative claims of the rival candidates; and denounced Peabody, who was present, as morally, politcally and personally unfit for the place, and unworthy of the public confidence.  On taking the question by yeas and nays, Peabody was found to have a majority of two votes, a support much short of what he had received on the trial by ballot.  But the attack, though unsuccessful in the House, was not made in vain.  The Senate rejected the nomination, and sent down the name of Bartlett, which was concurred in by the House."  Life of William Plumer by his son William Plumer Junior.  Boston.  1857.  103.</note>
