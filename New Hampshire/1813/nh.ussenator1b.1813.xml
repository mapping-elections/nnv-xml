				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"In spite of their nominal majorities in the legislature, the Republicans of New Hampshire in 1812 were fatally weakened by the defection of their Peace party members.  This not only led to their defeat in the presidential and congressional elections but made itself dramatically evident in their failure, during two full sessions, to elect a United States senator.  Responsibility for this debacle lay with Josiah Sanborn of Epsom, who had been elected to the senate as a Republican but who belonged in spirit to the Peace party (fn: Plumer to William Plumer, Jr.  December 5, 1812, Letters 4, Plumer Papers (Library of Congress)).  He voted against all Republicans nominated by his colleagues and insisted upon the election of John Goddard, who, since his electoral vote against Madison, had of course become anathema to the party stalwarts.  The legislature finally adjourned without electing a senator, thus permitting the Federalists to send Jeremiah Mason to the Senate in 1813."  The Ninth State.  278.</note>
