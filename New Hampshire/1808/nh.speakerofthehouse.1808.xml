                <note resp="Philip Lampi">"In a late Boston Centinel we find it stated that the votes for Speaker in the New-Hampshire Legislature, at their late session, were 89 republican, and 72 federal - by which it would be understood that a Federalist had 72 votes.  From what data the editor of that paper made his calculations, we are not informed; but it is a fact, taht (sic) of 157 votes given for Speaker, CHARLES CUTTS, Esq. a republican, had 156!  If the strength of Federalism is to rest upon this vote, it will be found to be in the 'back ground.'"  Political Observatory (Walpole, NH).  June 27, 1808.</note>
