				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"County of Cheshire, whole number of votes 5406 - 2704 making a choice; Hon. Moses Hale, Esq. having 2685, Moses Hall, Esq. 137, which in the opinion of your committee were intended for Moses Hale, Esq.; which if so intended would make 2822 for the Hon. Moses Hale, Esq. --- The Hon. Nahum Parker, Esq. 2548; which statement your committee beg leave to submit to be decided by the Hon. convention."  Journal of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, 1805.  15.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The Convention then took under consideration the votes from the town of Westmoreland, in the county of Cheshire.  Motion was made, that all the votes returned for Councillor from the town of Westmoreland, except those returned for Nahum Parker, and except the two scattering votes, be considered as returned for Moses Hale, and added to the number of votes returned for Moses Hale; but the motion was lost.  It was then moved, that the votes given in Westmoreland for Moses Hall, be considered as scattering votes; which passed in the affirmative.  By this, no choice was made by the people; and Moses Hale and Nahum Parker being the two highest candidates, the Convention proceeded to ballot for a Councillor, and elected Nahum Parker for the county of Cheshire.  [It may here be remarked, that the member from Westmoreland, and the Senator from the 10th district, who also resides in Westmoreland, both acknowledged, that no person by the name of Moses Hall was a candidate for any office whatever, on the day of election.  The return, however, of the town clerk, appeared to be Hall - whether he designedly made the e final as long as the preceding l, or whether it is his usual way of writing to make his e after an l at the end of a word, as long as the l, must be determined hereafter.  It is a subject that will not pass without inquiry.  It is expected that this decision of the Legislature will expose the town clerk to an indictment for making a false return.]  It was voted, that the Secretary be directed to erase from the votes given by the town of Westmoreland for Councillor, those in the column under Moses Hale, Esq. and credite Moses Hall, Esq. with the votes, as certified by the selectmen and town clerk."  Courier of New Hampshire (Concord, NH).  June 12, 1805.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The committee appointed by the convention to re-examine the returns for councillors reported that there was a choice for each county except in the county of Cheshire, and even in that county had the returns been as it was supposed, by said committee, to have been intended. But what Pilate said, in another case, might apply in this, what is written is written. The votes of Westmoreland were returned, 137 in number, for Moses Hall, instead of for Moses Hale. The committee submitted the matter to be decided by the convention. It had been an invariable rule of the convention, in such cases, that all votes should be set to the person for whom the clerk of the town in which they were given, had, in his official capacity, declared them to belong. This being the case, Moses Hale esq. had not a legal choice,--as will appear by what follows--The whole number of votes was 5406--2704 made a choice--Mr. Hale had 2,685, exclusive of the votes (137) which were returned from Westmoreland for Moses Hall, but which, it was presumed, were intended for Moses Hale. He of course fell short of his election by the people, in conformity to the rule of the convention. Nahum Parker esq. had 2540 votes, and was also not chosen by the people. He and Mr. Hale being the two highest candidates on the list, the convention proceeded to make choice of one of them as councillor for the county of Cheshire, and Nahum Parker was chosen by a very handsome majority." Political Observatory (Walpole, NH), June 15, 1805.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"In the county of Cheshire, in consequence of some irregularity of the votes in one or more towns, there was no choice by the people, and the vacancy was filled by ballot of the two Houses."  Portsmouth Oracle (Portsmouth, NH).  June 15, 1805.</note>
				<note resp="Philip Lampi">"The returns sent by me to the Secretary for Councillor, were meant to be Hale, not HALL, agreeable to the Record.  Caleb Aldrich, Town Clerk.  Westmoreland, June 15, 1805."  Courier of New Hampshire (Concord, NH).  July 31, 1805.</note>
